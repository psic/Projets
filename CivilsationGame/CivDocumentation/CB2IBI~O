This FAQ seeks to provide answers for a variety of questions related to
Civilization 3. It contains information for basic issues such as setup
and simple strategies, yet also answers deeper issues like corruption,
culture, and more. The goal of this is to become a resource where
players of all skill levels can find answers to questions they might
have, and hopefully learn something new.</a><br>

<br>
<b>What versions of Civilization 3 are there?</b><br>
<br>
There are 3 different games: Regular Civilization 3 without Expansions
(referred to as "Vanilla"), the Play the World (PTW) expansion pack,
which added new civilizations, artwork, and multiplayer, and the latest
Conquests (C3C) expansion pack, which added more civilizations,
scenarios, maps, and enhanced multiplayer. There are also collections
of games: Civilization 3 Gold is Play the World and Civ3 together.
Civilization 3 Complete is all 3 of the games.<br>
<br>
Throughout the article you may see the following: <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, and <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>
-- these refer to the different versions of the game, as some rules
have changed and are different. If you use the Black theme, the Play
the World's color may not appear well, so I suggest you use another
style. All others work fine.<br>
<br>
<b>What game should I buy?</b><br>
<br>
It all depends on what you currently have. If you don't have any Civ3
game, Civilization 3 Complete is best because it includes all the
content. If you have Vanilla Civ3, Conquests is best, as it includes
all PTW files as well!<br>
<br>
<b>Do I need to patch my game?</b><br>
<br>
For starters, a patch is an update to the game released after the game
to fix bugs and other problems. To check your game's patch level, load
Civ3 and check the bottom left of your screen (Vanilla Civ3 might say
1.29f -- indicating it has the latest patch). If you have Civilization
3 Complete, the game is already patched to the fullest (version 1.22
for Conquests). If your game doesn't have the most recent patch (<i>1.29f for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>, 1.27f for <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, 1.22 for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b></i>), you can download them <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/patches/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Save to your desktop and run them.<br>
<br>
<b>How can I get the game to run in a higher resolution?</b><br>
<br>
By default, the game runs in a 1024x768 resolution. To get it to run in
a higher resolution, navigate to your Civilization 3 folder (default: <i>C:/Program Files/Infogrames Interactive/Civilization 3/ -- if you have PTW or C3C, go to that folder inside your Civ3 one</i>), and open your .ini file (named <i>Civilization3.ini</i> for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>, <i>ptw.ini</i> for <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, and <i>conquests.ini</i> for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>).  Add a line at the bottom that says: <i>KeepRes=1</i> .  Now, when you load your game, it'll use your computer's default resolution.<br>
<br>
<b>When I try to install, I get a data2.cab error.</b><br>
<br>
This error usually means a dirty disk.  Try cleaning your disk, and retrying the install.<br>
<br>
<b>For other technical-related questions, visit our <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=48" target="_blank">Tech Support Forum</a>, and the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=118126" target="_blank">Tech Support FAQ</a>.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="BASIC"><font size="4"><b>Basic Questions</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>How long is a game of Civilization 3?</b><br>
<br>
The standard game length is 540 turns, though it can be modded (up to
1000 turns). You can still play more turns after 2050 AD, as many as
you want, but it won't keep score, nor will you be able to win another
victory condition. (You won't be able to launch a spaceship, for
example, past 2050 AD). It is split up into 4 'ages', Ancient,
Medieval, Industrial, and Modern, roughly equal in length.<br>
<br>
<b>How do I win?</b><br>
<br>
There are 6 standard victory conditions:<blockquote>Domination: 66% of the land AND population<br>
Conquest: defeat all other civilizations<br>
Diplomatic: be elected Secretary General of the United Nations<br>
Space Ship: build all 10 required spaceship parts<br>
Histographic: have the highest score at the end of the game<br>
Cultural: have either 20,000 culture in one city, or 100,000 culture across your empire<br>
<br>
In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, the Cultural
victory nationwide was changed to 60,000 for a Tiny map, 80,000 for
Small, 100,000 for Standard, 130,000 for Large, and 160,000 for Huge.</blockquote><br>
<b>How exactly do I build my spaceship?</b><br>
<br>
First, you need to build the <i>Apollo Program</i> (requires the
technology Space Flight). Then, by researching various techs in the
Modern Age, you will be able to build the various parts (for example,
SS Engine, SS Thrusters, etc.) in your cities, provided you have the
required resources for each part. Once you are done, hit F10, and it
will take you to the Space Ship screen. You can then hit "Launch" and
watch the movie. <img src="Civilization%20III:%20Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20-%20CivFanatics_fichiers/smile.gif" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" border="0"><br>
<br>
<b>How does the United Nations (UN) work?</b><br>
<br>
Any civilization is able to build the UN once it discovers Fission
(Modern Age). After it is built in a city, you can choose to have
elections for Secretary General. Each civilization gets 1 vote, and can
vote for one of the candidates. At maximum, there can be three
candidates: the civilization that builds the UN is always a candidate,
and then if civilization(s) have 25% of the land OR population, they
will also be eligible. If there are no civilizations with 25% land or
population, then the civilization with the highest score becomes the
second candidate. If a civilization gains a majority of the votes in
the election, they become Secretary General and win a diplomatic
victory! If not, the election is inconclusive. The choice for the
founder of the UN to have elections comes around every 11 turns - and
it is up to them to hold a vote (sometimes you might want to not have a
vote, for example, so that an AI doesn't win a diplomatic victory!)<br>
<br>
<b>What types of difficulty levels are there?</b><br>
<br>
There are 6 difficulty levels in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, and 8 in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.
They are: Chieftain, Warlord, Regent, Monarch, Emperor, (Demigod),
Deity, (Sid). The parenthesized ones are Conquests-only. At Warlord and
Chieftain, you'll have a weaker AI that is penalized (it takes them
longer than you to build things, research techs, etc.). At Regent, the
AI and you don't have any advantages nor disadvantages. Above Regent,
the AI starts to get some bonuses, like extra units at the beginning of
the game, faster production and research, lower corruption, etc. For a
detailed list of what bonuses/penalties the AIs gets, see <a href="#AIBONUS">this question</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>How can I delete saved games?  Can I organize them?</b><br>
<br>
Your saved games are stored in your Civilization 3 folder, in the subfolder called Saves (<i>C:/Program
Files/Infogrames Interactive/Civilization 3/Saves/ -- add a /Conquests/
or /Civ3PTW/ before the Saves folder if you have an expansion pack</i>).
If you navigate there in Windows Explorer, you can delete files as you
normally do - right click, and select "Delete". You can also click and
drag to delete them.<br>
<br>
Another cool feature is the ability to have folders. Right click, and
select New -&gt; Folder, and give it a name. That way, you can have
folders for, say, games that you have completed.<br>
<br>
<b>Can I take screenshots in Civ3?</b><br>
<br>
Yes, you can. For people that don't know, a screenshot is pretty much a
picture of your screen. Before you load Civ3, open a photo program,
even MS Paint. Then, in game, just press "Print Scrn" (to the right of
F12), and a screenshot will be copied to the clipboard. Hold <i>Alt</i> and <i>Tab</i>
and open Paint - then, go Edit -&gt; Paste, and you'll see your
screenshot. You can continue to take as many screenshots as you'd like.

<br>
<a name="TRAITS"><b>What are 'traits'?</b></a><br>
<br>
Traits are characteristics assigned to civilizations - each civilization has two (for example, America is <i>Industrious and Expansionist</i>).
They give civilizations a bit of uniqueness, and they also give small
bonuses. Traits also determine which two technologies a civilization
starts with (2 traits, 1 technology for each, so 2 starting techs).
There are 8 traits; here is a list of them:<br>
<blockquote><i>Industrious:</i>  Industrious civilizations start with Masonry.  Workers complete improvements faster (100% faster in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>.  50% faster in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.)
Also, all cities get an extra shield in the city center upon becoming a
Metropolis (Size 13 &lt; ), unless they were founded on a tile that
produced at least 1 shield, in which case they get it at Size 7.<br>
<br>
<i>Commercial:</i> Start with Alphabet. City centers get an extra
commerce upon becoming a City, and another at becoming a Metropolis.
The OCN (Optimal City Number) is increased 25% for Commercial
civilizations. <br>
<br>
<i>Religious:</i> Start with Ceremonial Burial. Religious buildings
(Temples, Cathedrals) are all half price. Also, anarchy between
government switches only lasts 1 turn in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, and only 2 turns in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.<br>
<br>
<i>Expansionist:</i> Start with Pottery. They also start the game with
a scout (a 2 movement unit, but cannot attack/defend), and can build
scouts, unlike non-EXP civilizations. Expansionist civilizations do not
get barbarians from goody huts, and have higher chances of getting
better results form them.<br>
<br>
<i>Militaristic:</i> Start with Warrior Code (or the Wheel).
Militaristic buildings like Barracks, Walls, Harbors, etc. are all half
cost. Unit promotions to higher levels are twice as likely as non-MIL
civilizations.<br>
<br>
<i>Scientific:</i> Start with Bronze Working. Scientific buildings
(Libraries, Universities, Research Labs) are half price. Upon entering
a new age, they receive a free technology (one of the starting
technologies for that age). In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, they also have a better chance of spawning Scientific Great Leaders.<br>
<br>
<i>Agricultural:</i>  Only available in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.
Start with Pottery. Provides one bonus food in the city square in all
governments except Despotism. In Despotism, the bonus food only appears
if the city is by fresh water (river or water body less than 22
squares). Half-price Aqueduct, Hospital, Solar plant, and Hydro plant.
Irrigated desert produce 2 food instead of 1. <br>
<br>
<i>Seafaring:</i>  Only available in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.
Start with Alphabet. Cities on the coast of salt water gain one extra
commerce in the city square. Naval units have 1 extra movement. Less
chance of sinking in sea/ocean. Half price harbor, commercial dock,
offshore platform. </blockquote>To see which civilizations have which traits, visit <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/civilizations/" target="_blank">this page</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>What is a Golden Age (GA)?</b><br>
<br>
A golden age a 20-turn period of increased production and commerce for
a civilization. Each tile that produces at least 1 commerce/production
will produce an extra commerce/production, respectively. A civilization
can only have 1 in a game. There are 2 ways to start one: by winning a
battle with your Unique Unit (see next question), or by building a
Great Wonder or combination of Great Wonders with your civilization's
traits (e.g. Since the Chinese are MIL/IND, if they build the Great
Wall, which is MIL/IND, they will spark a Golden Age). The bonuses from
a Golden Age, however, are still subject to the Despotism tile penalty.<br>
<br>
<b>What are Unique Units (UUs)?</b><br>
<br>
Unique units are units that are only available to a specific
civilization, and they usually were important in that country's
history. For example, Japan builds Samurai. Unique units replace
another unit (the Samurai replaces the Knight -- Japan can't build
Knights, only Samurai), but also have extra bonuses. For example, the
Samurai has an extra defense point than a Knight. When they win a
battle, if a civilizaiton hasn't had its Golden Age, they will begin
one.<br>
<br>
<a name="VICTORYCONDITIONS"><b>What are other options when creating the game, such as Culturally Linked Starts, Preserve Random Seed, Regicide, and others?</b></a><br>
<br>
Culturally Linked Starting Locations means that civilizations in the
same 'culture group' (e.g. the European group includes Britain, France,
Germany, etc.) tend to start near each other in a game. Preserve Random
Seed means that the randomly generated number for something such as a
battle or anarchy calculation will be stored in the game so that you
cannot save your game and reload continuously to get a favored outcome.
This is used in most Single Player games, especially competitions.
Respawn AIs means that when an AI is killed off, if there is a 5x5 plot
of land not in a civilization's cultural borders, they will respawn
there as a new civilization with only one city. A civilization can
respawn forever as long as there is a 5x5 piece of territory.<br>
<br>
The remaining options (Regicide, Elimination, Mass Regicide, Victory
Point Scoring, Capture the Princess, and Reverse Capture the Flag) are
mainly for Multiplayer. In Regicide, you have a "King" unit (1 attack,
1 defense, 2 movement). If another civilization kills it, you are
eliminated. In Mass Regicide, you have 7 Kings. In Elimination, if you
lose a city, you are eliminated (or you can specifiy a number of cities
by selecting "Game Limits" on the Player selection screen). With VP
scoring, you gain points for things like cities conquered, units
defeated and techs researched, and you have to gain a certain amount
(again, specifiable in that screen). Also, in certain scenarios like
WWII: Pacific, you gain points for units that control an obelisk,
representing a victory point location. There is a myriad of ways VP
Scoring is used. Capture the Princess is where each civ has an
unmoveable Princess unit in their capital -- if another civ captures it
and brings it to their capital, they get a point and gold bonus.
Another princess is then replaced in the former capital. Reverse
Capture the Flag is where you bring a unit to a certain location.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Accelerated Production?</b><br>
<br>
This is a setting intended for Multiplayer games, as it speeds up the
game - half the turns, double the growth, research, half build costs,
etc. It speeds up the game tremendously, though it is a bit unbalanced
(workers still improve terrain that the normal terrain).<br>
<br>
<b>How do resources work?</b><br>
<br>
There are 3 types of resources - strategic (needed to build
units/buildings), luxury (make citizens happy), and bonus (give extra
food/shields/commerce). If you connect any resource (except bonus ones)
to your cities, you can then 'use' that resource. For luxury resources,
each of the 8 luxuries you bring into your cities will make your
citizens happier. With strategic resources, if you connect a resource
to your cities, you can then build units that require it. For example,
if you hook up Iron, you can then build Swordsmen. There is no limit as
to how many units you can build off of a resource. They
deplete/reappear randomly across the globe over time.<br>
<br>
<a name="AIBONUS"><b>What types of bonuses/disadvantages does the AI receive?</b></a><br>
<br>
The AI get a variety of bonuses and disadvantages depending on
difficulty level. On Chieftain, the cost factor (basically a cost
modifier; default is 1) is 2 for the AI - meaning everything takes
twice as long to do, from researching a tech, to building a worker.
However, on Emperor, the cost factor is .8, and the AI gets a reduced
anarchy time! Here's a table with the major information - for more, see

<a name="EMPIRE"><font size="4"><b>Empire Management Questions</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>How do governments work?  How do I switch governments?</b><br>
<br>
Each civilization in a game has a type of government - the default is
Despotism. There are 8 governments: Despotism, Republic, Monarchy,
Democracy, Communism, Anarchy (lack of a government), and in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
Fedualism and Fascism. There are various rewards/drawbacks of the
governments - you have to chose the best one. For exmaple, a government
like Monarchy has very high unit support (you pay less gold for unit
upkeep) and you can station units in your cities to keep the citizens
happy (called <i>Military Police, or MP</i>). In Republic, it has low
unit support and no MP allowed - but it gives a commerce bonus to your
cities. Governments also affect corruption - Democracy has low
corruption, but has high War Weariness (your citizens do not like war).
Choosing a government is all about weighing your options. For a
detailed guide of governments, check out <a href="http://www.civfanatics.net/downloads/civ3/reference/Civ3C3Cdata.zip" target="_blank">this <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b> PDF</a>.<br>
<br>
Upon discovering a technology that enables a new government, you can
opt to have a revolution. If you do, you go through a period of anarchy
(see next question). To revolt into a new government, hit F1 to go to
the Domestic Advisor and select the button that has your current
government's name (e.g. "Despotism").<br>
<br>
<b>What is anarchy?  Is there anyway to make it shorter?</b><br>
<br>
Anarchy is the time spent between governments, aka a "revolution"
period. When you change governments, you enter anarchy - in anarchy,
your cities don't produce any shields, and you can't research. You
can't hurry production, but your cities will grow! It is essentially
mimicing chaos. For Religious civilizations, anarchy only lasts 1 turn
in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, and 2 turns in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.  For non-Religious civilizations, the formula is: 1 (2 for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>)
+ random number between 1-4 + number between 0-3 depending on size of
your empire. The calculation is pretty much based on luck and the size
of your civilization - if you revolt when it is smaller (earlier in the
game), it is more likely to be shorter, but not necessarily.<br>
<br>
<b>What is my trade network?</b><br>
<br>
A civilization's trade network is its connection of cities to each
other via road (most common), harbors (over water), and airports
(through the air). All cities connected to a trade network share the
same resources; for example, if you have 1 source of Iron connected via
road to a nearby city, and that city is connected to your other five
towns, all 6 of your towns will be able to use that Iron! This way, one
resource can be used in all of your cities nationwide. Also, connecting
your cities to the trade network and your capital will also reduce
corruption.<br>
<br>
<b>I'm losing a lot of money!  How can I starting gaining money?</b><br>
<br>
There are a couple of ways where you can lose money. On the F1 Domestic
Advisor screen, you can see a breakdown of where you are losing your
money (as well as where you are raking in the cash). Here's a
description of what those lines mean:<br>
<blockquote><i>Science:</i> This is pretty straightforward. It's how
much gold is being converted into beakers for science research. The
higher your science slider is (the slider to the right with the
beaker), the more money you will spend on science instead of earning in
gold. This is an easy way of earning more gold - turn down the slider
and sacrifice some science for gold, if you are losing lots of gold.
Also, when you only have 1 turn left to research a tech, try turning
the science slider down - sometimes you can still get the tech in 1
turn, while earning extra gold.<br>
<br>
<i>Entertainment:</i> This represents another slider - the luxury tax
slider (below the science slider). It represents how much gold is being
turned into "happy faces", or entertainment to turn your citizens in
cities happy to prevent riots (a riot happens when &gt;50% of the
citizens in a city are unhappy). This you usually can't turn down
without having some repurcussions in your cities.<br>
<br>
<i>Corruption:</i> This shows how much money is being lost to
corruption. Every city doesn't utilize every commerce it earns - some
is just, literally, 'lost', as in you can't use it. This is usually
higher the larger your empire is, as there will be more corruption. For
ways to lower this, see <a href="#CORRUPTION">this question</a>.<br>
<br>
<i>Maintenance:</i> This is how much gold you are paying to maintain
city improvements. For example, if you have 5 cities, and each has a
temple (1 gold in upkeep per temple), you will pay 5 gpt in upkeep.
This can add up quickly with a large empire, and it is hard to stop;
you have to watch what you build and make sure it is necessary.<br>
<br>
<i>Unit Costs:</i> This shows how much money is being paid to maintain
units that aren't supported by your government. Different governments
have different limits, and how much you pay in upkeep. For example, if
you go over the limit in Monarchy, you pay 1gpt per unit extra.
Republic is 2gpt. Feudalism is 3gpt! Make sure you don't go too high
over the limit for this, as it can add up quickly. It helps to disband
old units or units in your core away from borders of other civs. For
more, see <a href="#UNITUPKEEP">this question</a>.<br>
<br>
<i>To Other Civs:</i> This is pretty simple - it is how much gold per
turn you are giving to other civilizations in diplomacy (e.g. If you
trade 10gpt to a civilization for a technology, "-10" will appear in
this column. Similarly, there is one on the positive side of things for
money you are receiving.</blockquote>Here are some good ways to earn
some money besides the one mentioned above: try building marketplaces,
banks, and stock exchanges - they increase gold by 50%. Roads are also
the key. Every tile with a road produces an extra commerce. The
governments Republic and Democracy all have a trade bonus so that for
every tile that produces one commerce, you'll get an extra. That is one
reason Republic is considered the best government. Lowering corruption
is an effective way of earning money too.<br>
<br>
<a name="UNITUPKEEP"><b>How many units should I ideally have?</b></a><br>
<br>
This is hard to determine - it is usually case by case. However, there
are some guidelines: once you've expanded, it's best to just station
most of your units on the border cities - after all, they have to take
those cities before they can get to your core! This is especially true
for railroads, when you can move units anywhere in one turn. The number
of ideal units also depends on your goverment. Some governments, for
example, have decent unit support (units you don't have to pay
maintanence for); e.g. Monarchy has 2 units/town, 4 units/city, 8
units/metropolis. With Monarchy, you can afford to have more units
stationed in your cities. However, in Republic in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
you get very little unit support - and each unit past the limit costs 2
gpt to maintain! Those costs can add up very quickly, so in this case
it is best to keep a smaller, more updated army. Don't be afraid to go
over the limit however, provided you make up for it in gold somewhere
else. If you have a specific game in question, don't hesitate to post
on the forums with your save and people will be there, eager to help!<br>
<br>
<b>If I irrigate grassland, it only produces 2 food instead of 3!  Why does it do this?</b><br>
<br>
This is called the <i>Despotism tile penalty</i>. In Despotism,
the standard government, all tiles that produce 3 or more
food/shields/commerce will produce one less. That's why grassland (2
food), when irrigated (+1 food) in Despotism, will only produce 2 food
(2 + 1 - 1 = 2). That's why it is best to mine grassland, unless it is
bonus food (for example a cow will produce 4 food irrigated in
Despotism) or you are about to switch governments. This rule also
applies to things like mined hills - instead of getting 3 shields (1
base + 2 from the mine), you only get (3 - 1 = 2), 2.<br>
<br>
<b>What is mobilization?</b><br>
<br>
Mobilization is a special state you can place your nation in. It is
aimed for civilizations fighting many wars that need a significant
boost in their military production. Here's how it works: once you
research Nationalism, you have the option to go into Mobilization
(change it on the F1 Domestic Screen, from "Normal" to "Mobilization").
In Mobilization, you can only build military units (infantry, cavalry,
tanks, etc.) and military improvements (barracks, civil defense, etc.)
- the option to build things like a Temple don't even appear. However,
each tile that produces at least 1 shield will produce an extra (sort
of like a Golden Age, but not for commerce). While you get a boost
militarily, your infrastructure and cultural improvements will be a bit
lacking. All culture per turn from your city is halved as well (a
temple that normally produces 2 culture/turn only produces 1).<br>
<br>
While you can start Mobilization at any time, it only ends with a
declaration of war/a treaty for peace. That is, there are two
scenarios: one, you enter Mobilization in peacetime, and you build up
your army pre-war - then, when you declare war, you'll be back to
normal and will be able to build things as normal. Or two, you can be
normal up until war, when you enter Mobilization to build
units/military-related things until the war ends and peace is signed.
Note: <i>you don't have to enter Mobilization to fight in a war!  It is just an option that is there if you think it will benefit you!</i><br>
<br>
<a name="CORRUPTION"><b>What is corruption?  How does it work and how can I deal with it?</b></a><br>
<br>
Corruption is the loss of commerce (gold brought into your city) and
shields (this is called "waste") in a city. It is a very complicated
subject, for one because it depends on which game your a playing.
However, we'll start with some basics - while some of the following
applies for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, it is written for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>:
corruption can never exceed 95% in a city. There are also two factors
in corruption: rank corruption (the rank of the city when all cities
are ranked by distance from the capital - e.g. the number of cities
closer to the Palace that it), and distance (the distance from the city
to the nearby Palace or Forbidden Palace). For a more descriptive
analysis, I refer you to the links at the end of this question.<br>
<br>
There are a few ways to combat corruption. One is by building
corruption-reducing improvements (Courthouses and Police Stations -
they decrease the distance corruption and lower the maximum amount of
corruption), and another is by connecting the city to your capital.
Corruption is also affected by your difficulty level (the higher the
level, the higher the corruption), and whether or not your are a
Commerical civilization. Changing your government to one with lower
corruption also works well, as does building the Forbidden Palace (see <a href="#FP">next question</a>).  Also, in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, you can use the Policeman specialist to 'uncorrupt' one corrupted commerce and shield.<br>
<br>
For a more in depth study, see these great threads by alexman: for <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=19922" target="_blank"><b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b></a> and for <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=76619" target="_blank"><b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b></a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="FP"><b>What does the Forbidden Palace do?  How many can I build?</b></a><br>
<br>
The Forbidden Palace is a Small Wonder (each civilization can build
one, and only one, FP), which helps to lower corruption in that city
and nearby cities. Here's how it works (in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>):
in distance corruption calculations, it acts as a second Palace,
thereby lessening the distance corruption for cities that aren't too
close to your real Palace. However, it has no effect on rank
corruption. It is buildable at any time in the game, provided you have
half the number of "Optimal Cities" (see <a href="#OCN">this question</a>)
for that map size. If the city you built it in gets razed, you can
rebuild the FP elsewhere, as long as you still meet the OCN requirement.<br>
<br>
<b>What map sizes are there?  How are they different?</b><br>
<br>
There are 5 standard map types: Tiny (60x60), Small (80x80), Standard
(100x100), Large (130x130), and Huge (160x160) - their sizes are in
parentheses. Of course, the larger the map, the longer the game will
take to play, as there will be more civilizations, more cities, more
units, more everything! Other than that, there aren't many differences
between them - the settings like distance between civilizations at the
start of the game are all proportionate to the size of the map, so it
is pretty even throughout the maps. The only major change is the
increase of the <a href="#OCN">Optimal City Number</a> as the map size increases.<br>
<br>
<a name="OCN"><b>What is the "Optimal City Number"?  How is it used?</b></a><br>
The optimal city number is a figure that has two main purposes, and
differs on different map sizes. The first use of it is for the check to
see if you can build the Forbidden Palace - if you have a number of
cities greater than or equal to half the OCN, you can construct the FP.
The second purpose of the OCN is for corruption. If a player's number
of cities exceeds that number, corruption will increase dramatically in
subsequent cities. This can be modified by things such as having the
commercial trait, your government, if you have built the FP, and
others. The OCN for map sizes are as follows:<br>
<blockquote><i>Tiny:</i> 14<br>
<i>Small:</i> 17 <br>
<i>Standard:</i> 20<br>
<i>Large:</i> 28<br>
<i>Huge:</i> 36</blockquote><b>What is the difference between Great Wonders and Small Wonders?</b><br>
<br>
Both types of wonders give benefits to the civilization(s) that build
them - the only difference is who can build them. Great Wonders can
only be built once, by one civilization, and only they get the benefit
of that wonder. If that wonder is razed, no other civilization can ever
build it again; it is lost forever. However, Small Wonders can be built
by each civilization - so every civilization can get the benefit of
that wonder if they build it. For example, the Apollo Program is a
Small Wonder, and can be built by each civilization, as it is needed to
win the Space Race, although, say, the Sistine Chapel is a Great
Wonder, and can only be constructed by a single civilization.<br>
<br>
<b>What is research time affected by?  Is there any way to research faster?</b><br>
<br>
First off, here is the research cost formula for a tech: Research Cost
= [MM * [10*COST * (1 - N/[CL*1.75])]/(CF * 10)] - Research done so far
<br>
<br>
To see exactly what all the variables stand for, I refer you to <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=29485" target="_blank">this thread explaining it in depth</a>.
However, here is a short listing of how tech cost can vary: the size of
your map (you'll also have more cities and more commerce however, so it
evens out partially), the number of civilizations that already know the
technology, the number of civs in the game, the cost of the tech
(Ancient Age techs cost a lot less beakers to research than Modern Age
ones), and for the AI, what level the game is on (the higher the
difficulty level, the less time it takes to research (cost factor)).
Also, techs are very expensive to buy or research when no one knows
them, or only 1 or 2 civs do - these are called monopolies. When you
try to buy a technology from an AI and they're the only one that has
it, it is hard to get. However, this also works in your favor too;
humans like to research techs the AIs don't know and then sell them for
widely known techs.<br>
<br>
To research faster, there's a few ways: generate more beakers (roads
increase commerce), turn up the science slider (hit F1), build
libraries/universities/research labs, and research a tech no one knows
and trade it for a couple of techs everyone but you knows (called a
'2fer' or 'xfer' (2 for 1)). Also, check out <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=38631" target="_blank">this Tech Calculator</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>What are Scientific Great Leaders (SGLs)?</b><br>
<br>
Scientific Great Leaders are units that might appear when you are the
first to research a technology (and they are only found in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>).
They have the ability to rush anything in a city (improvement, wonder,
unit) and can also start an "Age of Science" (though it is bugged, and
it doesn't work, so don't use your SGL for this!) The chances of a
Scientific civilization to get a SGL upon researching a tech is 5% -
for non-Scientific civilizations it is 3%. SGLs can be unbalancing to
the game because of their strength and pure luck, but if you do play
with them on and receive one, be sure to use it wisely!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="CITY"><font size="4"><b>City Management</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>What is We Love the King Day (WLTKD)?</b><br>
<br>
We Love the King Day symbolizes that the citizens in a certain city are
happy, and thus, that city has lower waste (less shields lost to
corruption). You can tell as city is in WLTKD because there will be
what look like fireworks exploding over the city. The criteria for
WLTKD are as follows: a city, which must have at least 6 citizens,
cannot have any unhappy/resisting citizens, and at least half the
citizens must be happy. The city cannot also be starving (less than 2
food produced per citizen). If all the above is met, your city will
enter WLTKD! There is no limit on how many cities can celebrate this,
and it lasts until the city doesn't meet the aforementioned
requirements.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Civil Disorder?</b><br>
<br>
Civil disorder is when your city stops producing any commerce and
shields - it essentially stops all production in that city, although it
will still grow. It occurs whenever your city has more unhappy citizens
than happy. The city will riot (as seen on the map, where black smoke
rises from the city) until you get more citizens happy / not unhappy by
getting more luxuries, raising the luxury slider, hiring an entertainer
specialist, or anything else to boost happiness.<br>
<br>
<b>How do luxury resources and marketplaces affect my city?</b><br>
<br>
There are 8 luxury resources in the game (Spices, Dyes, Silks, Ivory,
Gems, Furs, Wines, Incense). For each luxury resource connected to your
cities, you'll make one citizen happy. So if you have 5 of the 8
luxuries (either domestically or imported from other countries), your
cities will get 5 happy citizens. If you have a city with 5 citizens,
all will be happy. Marketplaces act as a modifier to this luxury happy
citizen bonus. For the first two luxuries you have, you'll just get the
standard 1 happy citizen per each. For the 3rd and 4th you have, you
get 2 happy faces each. For the 5th and 6th, you get 3 each. For the
7th and 8th, you get 4 each. This way, if you have all 8 luxuries and a
marketplace in your city, you'll get an amazing 20 happy faces!<br>
<br>
<b>Why doesn't my city grow beyond size 6 and size 12?</b><br>
<br>
Sometimes a city, even when it has a surplus of food, won't grow past
size 6; this is because it needs an aqueduct. An aqueduct is a city
improvement available with Construction that you can build in any city
that doesn't have fresh water (a river or lake) next to the city.
Otherwise, the city won't grow past size 6. Likewise, all cities,
regardless of whether or not they have an aqueduct or fresh water, need
a Hospital (available with Sanitation) to grow past size 12.<br>
<br>
<b>Why can't I build a wonder in a city?</b><br>
<br>
There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to, but you
only need one to prevent you from building the wonder! If a wonder's
name appears gray in your <a href="#PRODQUEUE">production queue</a>,
look over these reasons. First off, you can only build a wonder in one
city. Also, you can't rush a wonder by sacrificing population
(Despotism, Communism, Fascism), by rushing it with gold (other
governments), or by <a href="#FORESTCHOP">forest chops</a>. So, if you
have done this on another item (say a Bank), and you try to switch from
building a Bank to a wonder, it won't let you because you hurried
production. Also, some wonders (Great and Small) require things before
you build them (e.g. SDI Defense requires 5 SAM Batteries built in your
cities; Wall Street requires 5 Stock Exchanges). Other wonders require
access to fresh water, while some require sea water (like the Colossus).<br>
<br>
<b>What do the numbers on the map screen next to my city mean?</b><br>
<br>
There are 3 numbers next to a city's name on the map screen. The first,
which is a number inside of a colored box to the left of the city,
indicates the city's population (all cities start at 1). The second,
directly below the city graphic, is the name of the city, and the
number of turns until it grows one population level. The last, below
the growth indicator, is what the city is currently producing (e.g. an
Archer), and how many turns until it is completed.<br>
<br>
<b>What do the little icons beside my cities on the map mean?</b><br>
<br>
There are 3 of them - and each stands for a different improvement. The
sword stands for a barracks, the anchor represents a harbor, and the
plane means the city has an airport. The latter two are visible on all
AI cities if they have them because they are important to see if you
can trade with a certain civilization.<br>
<br>
<b>What are specialists and how do they work?</b><br>
<br>
Specialists are a type of citizen that, while they don't work a tile
and bring in food/shields/commerce, provide other benefits to the city.
There are 5 specialists, and here are their descriptions (also, check
out <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/specialists.php" target="_blank">this article</a>):<blockquote><i>Entertainer:</i>  The entertainer provides 1 happy face to the city.<br>
<i>Taxman:</i>  The taxman provides 2 gold per turn (only 1 in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>).<br>
<i>Scientist:</i>  The scientist provides 3 beakers per turn (only 1 in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>).<br>
<i>Police Office (only in <font color="DarkRed"><b>Conquests</b></font>):</i>  The police officer reduces corruption in the city by 1 shield and 1 commerce.<br>
<i>Civil Engineer (only in <font color="DarkRed"><b>Conquests</b></font>):</i> The civil engineer provides 2 shields per turn (on limited things - only improvements and wonders).</blockquote><a name="FORESTCHOP"><b>How do forest chops affect my cities?</b></a><br>
<br>
All forests produce 1 food and 2 shields - but they also can be chopped
down. When you chop them down, 10 shields will be added to the current
thing being built in the nearest city (provided it isn't a wonder).
However, a tile can only be chopped once to get the 10 shield bonus (so
planting and chopping forests over and over again won't work), but you
can plant forests on tiles that aren't forested and then chop them to
get 10 shields. To view a diagram indicating where a forest chop will
go if two cities are equodistant from the forest, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads10/forestchop.png" target="_blank">this image</a> (see what value the forest is for each city - it goes to the lower value city).<br>
<br>
<a name="PRODQUEUE"><b>What is my production queue?</b></a><br>
<br>
If you select your current build in a city screen (middle right), it'll
bring up a menu where you can select what to build currently. However,
the production or build queue allows you slot items to be built in
succession, making it so you don't have to select what to build next
all the time. At the top of that menu, you'll see empty slots with
numbers adjecent to them. Here's how you can use the queue:<blockquote>Shift-Click - Adds to production queue.<br>
Shift-Del - Removes all items from the queue.<br>
Click-Del - Removes the item clicked.</blockquote><b>What is the city governor?  Is it good?</b><br>
<br>
The city governor is sort of like an automated human to control
decisions in your cities. You can enable it for one city, no cities, or
all of your cities - it's up to you. The general consensus among
regular civilization players is that it isn't that effective, for the
simple reason that it isn't as smart as a human. There are more
technical reasons as well, but we'll leave it at that for now. However,
if you do want to use it, here's what it can do for you: create a build
queue for you (select things to build), prevent riots when your city
has a majority of unhappy people, assign laborers to tiles when your
city grows, and 'emphasize' food/production/commerce in your city (e.g.
It might work the tiles that will give the most production, or food,
etc.) <br>
<br>
<b>How do factories and coal/solar/hydro/nuclear plants work?</b><br>
<br>
Factories and the other power plants all give a boost in production to
the cities they are built in. In order to build any other power plants,
you first need to have a factory built (it gives a 50% boost in your
base production). Then, if you have the required technology, you can
build one of the power plants (not all 3). They too will give a 50%
boost in your base production (before the factory's bonus); nuclear
power plants, however, give a 100% boost (although they can meltdown
during civil disorder). Later, you'll also be able to build a
Manufacturing Plant, which gives another 50% bonus on top of a factory
and a power plant.<br>
<br>
<b>When do my cultural borders for a city expand?</b><br>
<br>
You can tell how many turns until your city's borders expand by looking
in the top right of your city screen. It'll also show you how much
culture you have, how much culture per turn generated from
improvements/wonders, and how much culture you need until expansion.
The levels for cultural expansion are multiples of 10: it starts at 10,
then 100, then 1,000, then 10,000 (you don't get to 100,000, because
you'll win a cultural victory at 20,000).<br>
<br>
<b>If my city grows or builds something, will the shields or food carryover to the next build/population level?</b><br>
<br>
No - there is no shield or food carryover for cities, just like there
is no beaker carryover when researching a technology. If you have extra
shields being produced then are needed, they'll just go to waste. This
is where micromanagement enters the game. It's completely optional, but
if you pay close attention to the details, it does help. For example,
if you are building an archer (20 shields), and already have 17
shields, but produce 5 shields per turn, you're going to waste 2
shields. However, if you can reconfigure the citizens' tiles for that
city so that you still get 3 shields per turn, but you gain an extra
food per turn or more commerce, do so! All these shields/food/commerce
you'll save add up in the long run. There's nothing bad that comes out
of this; by watching your cities' growth and production carefully, your
civilization will become more effective.<br>

<br>
<b>What do the green/yellow/red bars next to my unit mean?</b><br>
<br>
The bars indicate what level your unit is at (each individual bar is
called a "hit point"). If you have 2 hit points (only drafted units
have 2 HPs), it is a conscript unit, 3 hit points is a regular, 4 hit
points is a veteran, and 5 hit points is elite. The colors of the bar
indicate its health (green = healthy, yellow = wounded, red = near
death). All units produced in cities without barracks are regulars. If
the city does have a barracks, they are veterans. Units can gain
experience (e.g. gain 1 HP and go up a level, for example from regular
to veteran) if they win a battle, as there is a certain chance a unit
will be promoted to a new level each time they do. For exact
statistics, see the next post.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the chances my unit will be promoted to a higher level?</b><br>
<br>
The probability your unit will be promoted after it wins a battle
depends on 3 things: what level it is currently at, whether you are
Militaristic or not (double the probability), and whether your battle
was fought against barbarians (half the probability). Don't forget the
luck factor involved.<br>
<blockquote><i>Non-Militaristic Civilization vs. Other Civilizations:</i><br>
Conscript to Regular: 1 in 2<br>
Regular to Veteran: 1 in 4<br>
Veteran to Elite: 1 in 8<br>
<br>
<i>Non-Militaristic Civilization vs. Barbarians:</i><br>
Conscript to Regular: 1 in 4<br>
Regular to Veteran: 1 in 8<br>
Veteran to Elite: 1 in 16<br>
<br>
<i>Militaristic Civilization vs. Other Civilizations:</i><br>
Conscript to Regular: 1 in 1<br>
Regular to Veteran: 1 in 2<br>
Veteran to Elite: 1 in 4<br>
<br>
<i>Militaristic Civilization vs. Barbarians:</i><br>
Conscript to Regular: 1 in 2<br>
Regular to Veteran: 1 in 4<br>
Veteran to Elite: 1 in 8</blockquote>If
a victorious unit does not get promoted, it will always be promoted if
it survives any other battle in the same turn. This is one reason why
units with Blitz (the ability to attack multiple times in a turn, such
as a Tank) are more likely to be promoted.<br>
<br>
<b>What are Military Great Leaders (MGLs)?</b><br>
<br>
Military Great Leaders are leaders spawned by an Elite unit in a
battle. They can do 2 things for you: build an Army (a group of units
fighting together) or rush an improvement or wonder. In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b> the rushing ability is limited to Small Wonders, but in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> or <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b> it can rush a Great Wonder.<br>
<br>
According to Sir Pleb's studies, you will get a leader for every 16
battles won by an Elite unit on average (a 1 in 16 chance). Building
the Heroic Epic improves the odds to 1 in 12. To build the Heroic Epic,
you must have won one battle with an Army. For more, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/leaders.php" target="_blank">this article</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>How do I build an Army?</b><br>
<br>
Once an Elite unit spawns a MGL, you can take that MGL to a city. Once
in the city, two new action buttons appear. One builds an army, the
other rushes an improvement (the latter button will not appear if the
city's build queue is set to a unit.) When you hit the "Build Army"
button, the MGL disappears from the game, and is replaced by a flag
bearer. This is the Army, but it's empty. You need to load units into
the Army, by moving up to 3 units to the city with the Army (if you
have the Pentagon, 4 units), and clicking the "Load" button . It is the
same button used to load units into boats. The units in this army will
fight seperately - one will fight until it's health gets low, and then
another will take its spot, etc. An Army will have a high amount of Hit
Points, allowing it to survive many battles.<br>
<br>
There are some differences between armies in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> or <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b> and <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>.  In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
an Army will get an additional movement point above the movement point
of the slowest unit in the Army. An army of Knights (usually 2
movement) will have 3 movement points. Armies in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b> can also pillage without using up any movement points.<br>
<br>
For more info about Armies, and what they can and cannot do, as well as the technicalities, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/armies.php" target="_blank">this article</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the Pentagon and the Military Academy, and what do they do?</b><br>
<br>
The Pentagon is a Small Wonder (buildable by every civilization), that
allows them to load 4 units instead of 3 into an Army. The Military
Academy is also a Small Wonder, and it lets civilizations build the
Army unit in the one city that the Military Academy was built in, as
normal units that cost 400 shields. Both of these Small Wonders require
a victorious Army before they can be built.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the attack value of my Armies in battle?  Is it the same as a normal unit?</b><br>
<br>
The following formula and notices are for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, but here is how your Army's attack value is calculated:<br>
<br>
Attack Value = A+(TA/N)<br>
<br>
A is the attack value of the unit currently fighting for the army, TA
is the value of all the Army's unit's attack values, and N is 6 (it is
4 if you built the Military Academy). All attack values that have
decimals are rounded down, and for its defensive value, just replace
the attack with defense values. <br>
<br>
<b>How long does it take for my units to heal?</b><br>
<br>
The length of time it takes for a unit to fully heal depends on where
the unit currently is. For starters, a unit can't start to heal unless
it hasn't moved this turn - so if you move a unit into a barracks and
then fortify it, it won't heal until next turn. However, if you have
fortified your unit with all movement points left, here are the times
for healing: if it is in a city with a barracks, it will heal
completely in one turn. If the unit is in a city, but it has no
barracks, it will heal 2 Hit Points per turn; if it is just outside in
your territory, it will heal 1 HP per turn. Unless you have built the
Battlefield Medicine (a Small Wonder), you cannot heal units in enemy
territory - once you have, you can heal units at the rate of 1 HP per
turn.<br>
<br>
<b>What are "bombardment" units and how do they work?</b><br>
<br>
Some land, air, and naval units have the "bombard" feature. Bombard is
the ability to potentially damage (in some cases kill, if it is an air
unit in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>)
a unit from another tile - that is, you don't actually move and attack
the unit on the same tile like you do with other units. Instead, they
stay on their current tile and bombard the enemy tile; not every
bombard will be successful. For example, a catapult does less damage
than an artillery. There are other factors for bombard units like rate
of fire (how many HPs it can take off maximum), bombard range (the
number of tiles away it can bombard), and bombard strength. With a
bombard unit, you click the button labeled "Bombard", and then a red
grid will appear. All tiles within this grid are within your unit's
bombard range - and the chances for a successful bombard do not depend
on distance. Bombard units can also attack cities (destroying
improvements/population) and land tiles (destroying terrain
improvements like roads, railroads, mines, etc.)<br>
<br>
<b>How do air units work?  What are the different "missions" they can do?</b><br>
<br>
Air units work in a different way than land or naval units in Civ3, as
well as the way they worked in Civ2. In Civ3, an air unit has to be
'stationed' in either a city or an aircraft carrier (or an airfield,
which is a worker-made terrain improvement, in either <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b> or <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>).
From their base, they can conduct various missions, all which take up
their movement for that turn. Before we go over the missions, here are
the different stats used for air units: Operational Range (the range
which the airplane can do a mission), Bombard Strength (literally the
strength of their attack), Rate of Fire (the maximum number of Hit
Points they can take off from a unit), as well as Defense Strength, in
case an opposing air unit or land unit attacks them during their
mission. In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, air units also have the ability to be lethal - that is, they can kill the unit they are bombarding.  In <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, air units cannot kill.  Here is a list of their missions:<blockquote><i>Bombing:</i>
A simple mission: the selected airplane attacks a unit, city, or tile
improvement within its range, and if it is successful, destroys some of
the unit's HPs, the tile improvement, population in the city, or a city
improvement.<br>
<i>Recon:</i> With this mission, a plane will reveal a 5x5 tile grid of
land within the operational range, and act as if those tiles are
visible to the civilization for the full turn (e.g. You can see the
enemy units move, workers working, etc.)<br>
<i>Re-base:</i>  This mission moves the selected air unit from its current base to a new city, aircraft carrier, or airfield (in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, they have an unlimited rebase range - in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, it is 3 times their operating range).<br>
<i>Precision Bombing:</i> When a unit does a precision strike, the air
unit will bombard the tile and target city improvements over anything
else, followed by city population if there are no improvements left.<br>
<i>Air Superiority:</i>  This mission allows fighters and jet fighters to shoot down a plane trying to do a bombing/precision bombing mission, but <i>not</i>
a recon or rebase mission. If selected, the fighter will 'patrol' a
region around him equal to half his operational range (e.g. A Fighter
will have a air superiority range of 3). If an airplane comes by on a
bombing mission, there is a certain percentage it will attack it (50%
for regular planes, only 5% for stealth planes). If it does attack it,
there will be an air battle, in which either one or both planes will be
damaged, and one might be shot down (this is where the planes' attack
and defense values enter). A plane can only engage another plane once
per turn.</blockquote><b>How do I upgrade old units?  Does it cost money?</b><br>
<br>
To upgrade an obsolete unit to a newer one (say a Spearman to a
Pikeman), you first have to move it to a city with a barracks (that
also has the required resources for the new unit). Then, assuming you
have the sufficient gold funds, you can hit "U" and it will tell you
how much it will cost, and then you can upgrade it. Alternately, you
can upgrade all units of that same kind in cities with barracks across
your empire by hitting "Shift-U". The formula for the gold cost is:
(difference in shields) * (3 for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b> or 2 for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>).  So using the Spearman to Pikeman example, it would be (30-20) * 3, or 30 gold per unit upgrade.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the army draft?</b><br>
<br>
The draft is a way to create units quickly when you are running short
of military (you need to have discovered Nationalism to draft units).
Each turn, you can 'draft' a select number of units from cities across
your nation. These units use up 1 population in a city, and the city
you drafted them in has to have at least 6 population. However, because
these aren't trained units, they are Conscript units (only 2 HPs). The
unit you draft depends on what technologies you have and what resources
are available, but the units that will be drafted are the best possible
ones at the time from this list: Riflemen, Infantry, or Mechanized
Infantry. The number of units you can draft from a city in a turn is: 0
for Anarchy, 1 for Democracy and Republic, 2 for all others. To draft a
unit, go into a city and click the green button that has a soldier on
it on the city display (near the production queue). Also, be warned:
drafting units causes unhappiness in the city they came from, and take
note that you can only draft native citizens, so you can't draft units
from foreign cities you just conquered.<br>
<br>
<b>How do anti-aircraft units work?</b><br>
<br>
In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, there are 2
different land-based anti-aircraft units: Flak and Mobile SAM (Surface
to Air Missiles. You can move them to any tile or city just like any
regular unit, however, like some air units, they can attack air units
that are bombarding the tile they are on. Unlike airplanes with air
superiority, however, the chance to intercept an air unit with stealth
and without stealth is the same - but this percentage depends on if
there are other anti-aircraft units on the tile, and what type they
are, and some other factors. For a more in depth analysis, see <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=76227" target="_blank">this thread</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>What are a unit's attack, defense, and movement values used for?</b><br>
<br>
All land and ship units have the following values (air units are a bit
different, so see the earlier aircraft question) for attack, defense,
and movement. Movement is the easiest: this is the number of tiles the
unit can move in a turn. Most early units can only move 1 tile.
However, also be aware of the fact that some tiles 'require' multiple
movement points. For example, if a unit has 2 movement, it can't go
over 2 hill tiles in a turn, because a hill tile uses up 2 movement per
tile instead of the normal 1 - the unit can only go over 1 hill. Also,
when on a road, a unit can travel three tiles, regardless of the
underlying terrain. The attack and defense values are used for combat.
Although it may appear that if an attacking unit's attack strength is
2, and the defender has a defense of 2, the probability of either unit
winning is 50%, this is not so. This is because there are a series of
value modifiers that can affect both the attacker and defender. There
are things to calculate in like the defenders terrain, hit points, if
it is in a city or not, if it is a barbarian, and more. To see how
these affect combat, see <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7679" target="_blank">this thread</a> - even though it was made for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>, most of the info remains correct.  Once you are familiar with the preceeding, there is a simple online calculator you can use <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/combatcalc.php" target="_blank">here</a> to calculate probability of winning a battle that includes modifiers.  Alternatively, you can download <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=1526027" target="_blank">this</a>

<br>
<b>What happens if I disband a unit?</b><br>
<br>
If you disband a unit on any tile that is not a city, nothing happens:
the unit just disappears. However, if the unit was stationed in a city,
and you disband it, it creates some shields for that city's current
build. The number of shields added is 1/4 the shield cost of the unit,
rounded down. For example, an archer (normally 20 shields) will produce
5 shields. Because of this, sometimes it is worth it to disband old
units or costly units in a city where you badly need an improvement
(say a temple in a newly conquered city with no culture). Also, you
cannot get the shield bonus if you are building a wonder, but if it is
a unit or improvement, it will work.<br>
<br>
<b>Why do some of my ships sink at sea?  What is the probability of this?</b><br>
<br>
There are some ships available in the Ancient and Middle Ages that have
a chance to sink if they end their turns in sea or ocean tiles. For
curraghs and galleys, two Ancient Age ships, they must end their turns
in coast tiles, or they risk being 'lost at sea'. For caravels, a
Middle Age ship, they must end their turns in sea or coast tiles. If
either of these boats end their turns in ocean tiles, or
curraghs/galleys in sea tiles, they might sink. The percentage of a
ship to sink at sea depends on whether the civilization is Seafaring or
not. For Seafaring civilizations, the percentage is 25% that it will
sink - for non-Seafaring, it is 50%. Once you research Astronomy in the
Middle Ages, all ships (even old curraghs and galleys) will be able to
end their turns at sea safely. Upon researching Navigation <i>or</i> Magnetism, every ship is safe to end their turns in any tile.<br>

<b>How do I build an embassy?  Why should I?</b><br>
<br>
To build an embassy with a civilization, which requires the technology
Writing, hit Shift + E to bring up the espionage screen. Then, select
the civilization you want to establish one in, and select "Build
Embassy" (it will show you how much it costs). You can now tell you
have an embassy with a civilization because there will be a yellow dot
next to their leaderhead image on the F4 Foreign Advisor screen. When
you build an embassy, you'll finally be able to offer agreements with
that civilizations (not the trading of goods, but rather, treaties and
alliances), such as Military Alliances and Right of Passages. Unless
you have an embassy, you cannot do things like that. Also, with an
embassy, you can see what other civilizations they have met as well as
what civilizations they are at war/peace with on the F4 Foreign Advisor
screen. You can also undertake espionage missions such as investigating
a city of theirs, or attempting to steal a technology (though you can
also use spies, which are have better chances).<br>
<br>
<b>What are spies?  What are the different espionage missions I can do?</b><br>
<br>
Spies are not units in the game - that is, you don't move them around
on the map, nor can you 'build' them. However, spies become available
when you build the Intelligence Agency (available with Communism), and
once you do, you can 'plant' them in another civilization (in their
capital city). They sort of just appear on paper, because there is not
even a graphic for them on the map. To plant a spy once you have built
the IA, hit Shift + E and go to the espionage screen. Then you can
select the civilization you want to plant a spy in, pay the gold, and
hope it works (the chances to plant a spy depend on your government,
but it is around 50-60%). If it is not successful, the AI will become
mad at you and might declare war - if it is, however, you now have a
variety of 'missions' to carry out from that spy for that civilization
only:<blockquote><i>Investigate City:</i>  See the city screen of an enemy city (you can do this with just an embassy - no spy is required)<br>
<i>Steal Technology:</i>  Attempt to steal a technology that an AI has that you don't have.<br>
<i>Steal World Map:</i>  Steal an AI's world map (much like trading for it).<br>
<i>Steal Enemy Plans:</i> You get to see the AI's units, where they are
located, what level they are at, etc. It's like seeing your own units
except that you can't move them. It lasts for 1 turn (and the
interturn).<br>
<i>Sabotage Production:</i>  Attempt to discard all shields invested by an AI in one city on a build (whether it is a wonder, improvement, unit, etc.).<br>
<i>Expose Enemy Spy:</i> If you think an AI has a spy in your capital,
you can use this and try to 'expose' them (remove that spy). If
successful, it is removed. If they don't have a spy, you always fail
the mission and are caught.<br>
<i>Initiate Propoganda:</i> Attempt to incite a rebellion in a foreign
city and have them convert to your nation (much like when a city does a
culture flip) - does not work against an AI with Democracy as their
government.</blockquote>There are 3 levels you can do a mission at:
Immediately, Cautiously, or Safely - the more it costs, the more
successful you are likely to be. There are also various modifiers in
the missions - for more, see <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=97042" target="_blank">this article</a> by Oystein.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the ways that trade can occur between civilizations?</b><br>
<br>
There are three ways you can trade goods (specifically luxury or
strategic resources - not things like world maps, right of passages,
etc.) with an AI: by land, sea, or air. The land option requires you
have a road path from your capital to the AI's capital, whether it goes
directly to them (e.g. you are neighbors), or it travels through
another civilization (who you are both at peace with). However, a land
route like this can also be pillaged if there is only one road between
the two of you and an enemy unit pillages the tile, so it's best to
have multiple trade routes. Sea trade routes require each civilization
trading to have a city with a harbor (and then that city connected to
the capital city). Then, goods from the capital go to the harbor, which
go to the AI's harbor, then to their capital! You can only trade over
coast at the beginning of the game, though, but you can later trade
over sea tiles when you research Astronomy, and then all water tiles
including ocean when you discover Magnetism or Navigation. The last way
to trade goods involves airports (available after Flight) - then, you
just have to each have a city with an airport connected to the capital
city (or just have airports in the capital). The best part about this
is that as long as you two have airports connected to the capitals,
trade can occur!<br>
<br>
<b>I see a path from my capital to another AI's capital!  Why can't I trade my goods with them?</b><br>
<br>
There are numerous reasons why this could happen, and it is hard to
find out why it is happening, but here is a list of a few. First, the
roads in enemy territory leading to a civilization's capital might have
been pillaged, and your world map is out of date. Or, your roads or
harbors might require the use of another civilization's territory, whom
your trading partner is at war with. For sea trade, if you can only
trade over coastal tiles, a barbarian ship or enemy ship may be in the
path way if there is only 1 ship route to another civilization.
Regarding sea routes as well, you cannot trade over sea tiles until you
have Astronomy, and not over ocean tiles until you have Magnetism or
Navigation, so while there may be a route over the water, you might not
have the technology to trade over it yet. Trade embargoes could also be
a reason, whether you have a trade embargo you forgot about with
someone else against them, or they might have an embargo against you.
This is just a list of some reasons - they are many of them.<br>
<br>
<b>How does the trading of goods work?</b><br>
<br>
First, you have to bring up the diplomacy screen with the preferred AI
- there are two ways to do this. One, press Shift + D (if you have a
worker active in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
it is Shift + Control + D). Then, select from the list of AIs you have
met the one you want to trade with. Alternatively, go to the F4 Foreign
Advisor screen and double click on the leaderhead image of the
civilization you want to trade with. Then, at the next screen, select
the text that reads something like "Let's propose a deal..." (it's the
top option). After that, you can start offering and trading goods! Your
column of available items to trade is on the right; the AI's is on the
left. You can click your items to trade away, and click AI items you
would like to receive, and then see if they'll accept that. If not, you
may have to offer more in exchange for what you want. You can also see
what they're willing to offer in exchange for something by hitting
"What would you give?" (or something near that) on the bartering screen
- or you can see what they want for one of their items by hitting "What
would it take to give this away?" (or something close to that). All in
all, the best way to find out how to trade goods is to experiment on
that trade screen.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the different things I can trade?</b><br>
<br>
Here is a list of what you can trade (for descriptions of some of these, see <a href="#ROPMA">this question</a>):
Peace Treaties (if at war), Right of Passages, Military Alliances,
Mutual Protection Pacts, Trade Embargoes, World Maps, Territory Maps,
Luxury Resources, Strategic Resources, Lump Sum of Gold, Gold per Turn,
Technologies, and Cities (as part of a peace deal only). As you can
see, there is a variety of items and agreements which you can trade!<br>
<br>
<b>What does "Dyes (1 extra)" or something related to that mean?</b><br>
<br>
When trading resources, the numbers in the parentheses indicate how
many extra sources of that particular good you have to trade. This
assumes you don't want to trade out your last/only resource, of course.
So if you have 3 wines in your territory, it will show up as "Wines (2
extra)", and that is how you can know if you have extra 'copies' of the
resource to trade to the AIs. It is possible to see "ResourceName (0
extra)" if you only have 1 of that particular resource, or you traded
away the others. <br>
<br>
<b>Why are some resources grayed out?</b><br>
<br>
If resources are grayed out, it means you don't have a trade path to
the civilization, whether you don't have a road to the civilization or
the road to the civilization was pillaged, or something else. There are
a variety of ways this can happen - maybe you never had a trade route
to them, maybe it got destroyed, or maybe it is just temporarily
blocked (by, say, a barbarian galley). Please see <a name="TRADENOGO">this question</a> for some possibilities.<br>
<br>
<a name="ROPMA"><b>Why can't I sign a Right of Passage/Military Alliance/Embargo/etc.?</b></a><br>
<br>
Many of these trade agreements between civilizations require a certain
technology - and even if you have an embassy built, you still won't be
able to sign them until you have the prerequisite. Here is a list of
what's needed for them:<br>
<blockquote><i>Right of Passage:</i>  Map Making<br>
<i>Military Alliance:</i>  Writing<br>
<i>Mutual Protection Pact:</i>  Nationalism<br>
<i>Trade Embargo:</i>  Nationalism</blockquote><b>Why can't I trade world maps/communications with other civilizations?</b><br>
<br>
There are two technologies you have to research in order to trade these.  In <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
you cannot trade World/Territory Maps until you research Navigation.
For communications to other civilizations, you need Printing Press. In <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>,
the prerequisite for trading maps is Map Making, and for communications
trading it is Writing. Once you have the necessary technology, like all
tradeable goods, they will appear on your bartering table.<br>
<br>
<b>If I play a large or huge map, how can I get more than 8 civilizations to appear on the F4 Foreign Advisor screen?</b><br>
<br>
Although large and huge maps have over 8 civilizations in them (12 and
16 respectively), the Foreign Advisor screen can only show 8 (including
you). When you meet eight other civilizations or more, the first eight
will show up on the Foreign Advisor screen, and the other will be in
the drop down list called "More Civs" in the top left. To switch one
old civilization on the screen with one that you don't want, single
click it, and then select the new civilization from the drop down menu,
and they will now be switched. You can also Shift and Click on the
advisor you want to switch, and select the new civilization from there.<br>
<br>
<b>How can I see what deals I currently have going with another AI?</b><br>
<br>
There are two ways. The first is to initiate diplomacy with the
civilization (double click their leaderhead on the F4 Foreign Advisor
Screen), open the diplomacy table, and click "Active" at the bottom.
Then you can see who is giving what to each other, and how many turns
are left on the deals. Alternatively, you can go to the Foreign Advisor
screen again, <i>single</i>
click on a leaderhead, and select the "Active" tab to the right, and it
will also show you the deals there. To end an active deal, you can just
click on it, and not renegotiate the deal.<br>
<br>
<b>Why does the AI sometimes agree to trade me oil in exchange for very little?</b><br>
<br>
Sometimes you can get very cheap deals for oil from the AI before it
has any value. Because you can discover oil with Refining, you can
initiate a trade with the AI for oil then. However, since there aren't
any units that use it until Combustion, the AI treats it as a useless
resource (although it becomes a very important one) since it sees that
there is no benefit for you at that time (assuming you haven't
researched Combustion). The AI is usually willing to sell it dirt
cheap, and sometimes you can even demand it for you and they gladly
give it away, because it has no value for them. Once you get Combustion
and all the other techs giving units that require oil, the price goes
way up!<br>
<br>
<b>The AIs don't seem to have much gold per turn.  Why is this?</b><br>
<br>
On lower levels, at least early in the game, the AI usually has no
extra gold per turn. This is because they aren't too smart - they don't
build many roads, marketplaces, banks, and they usually don't have much
gold lump sum either. You have to wait until later on the in the game,
when the AIs strengthen and develop more - even then, they might not
have a lot. However, on higher levels, where they can build stuff
quicker (either workers to build roads, or marketplaces for gold), the
AIs usually have lots of gold, even early in the game. Sometimes late
in the game if they have a lot of extra military units, they might not
have a lot, but they'll still usually have some - the 'runaway AIs', or
the best AI in the game will usually have a ton of gold per turn, and
it is not rare to offer them a few techs for 500+ gold per turn. It's
really hit or miss - it depends on the difficulty level you're playing
at, what year you are in, as well as who you are seeking gold per turn
from.<br>
<br>
<b>Why won't the AI accept my gold per turn or any other 20-turn deal?</b><br>
<br>
If this happens, it means your reputation (seperate from your attitude,
or how the other AIs view you (Polite, Furious, etc.)) is tarnished. To
get your reputation to be tarnished, you need to have either: declared
war on them when you had units in their territory (this includes
ships), declared war on them when you had a 20-turn deal with them
(e.g. You declared war when you were trading them Dyes), or somehow
ended a 20-turn deal with them (whether the trade route between you and
them was pillaged, or an AI captured your only city with the resource
you were trading away, etc.). Basically, it boils down to: did you
fufill all your per-turn agreements with the AI? If one of them was
broken and it didn't last the 20 turns, your reputation is broken.
However, <i>if the AI declares war on you when you have a 20-turn deal going on</i>, it does <i>not</i>
count as a broken reputation - it is only if you are the agressor. Once
you have broken your reputation once, the AIs will never again for the
game accept per-turn payments or deals from you, because they don't
trust you. Reputation is very important in Civ3, and if you lose it
early on in the game, it makes life a lot harder! For more about
reputation, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/trading_reputation.php" target="_blank">this article</a> by microbe.<br>
<br>
<b>What is a 'blockade'?</b><br>
<br>
A blockade is a simple naval maneuver where one civilization's ships
surround an enemy city's water tiles. Upon doing this, that city, if it
had a harbor, now cannot trade out of that port. Blockades, while good
in theory, aren't too practical because they require a few ships per
enemy city, and if the enemy has a lot of coastal cities, it is near
impossible, plus your ships can be sunk. Even if you blockade their
ports, there are still other ways for them to trade (by air or by
having a road to another AI civilization with a port).<br>

<a name="STRATEGY"><font size="4"><b>Strategy</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>This section only gives a brief overview of commonly used tactics in
Civilization 3 - for a complete list of strategy articles in various
areas of the game, visit the <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy" target="_blank">War Academy</a>.</b><br>
<br>
<b>How should I effectively manage my workers?  What is the ideal number of workers?</b><br>
<br>
Most advanced civilization players agree that the worker unit is the
most important unit in the whole game, even though it has no
attack/defense values. The ability to improve the terrain around your
cities is key, and of course, the more workers you have, the faster
your civilization will grow and the better off you will be. However,
the number of workers you should ideally have can vary. Some say 1
worker per city is ok - although some go higher up, saying that 2
workers per city is crucial, especially in the early game. The more of
a head start you can build in the early game, the easier the rest of
the game is. No matter how many workers you have, it can't hurt to have
more. When managing your workers, it's pretty necessary to control them
manually, and not automate them. A human can always make better
decisions than the computer. There are a couple rules of thumb: try to
road every tile that your citizens are worker, so that you get the 1
commerce bonus roads bring. In Despotism, don't irrigate grassland
unless there is a bonus food resource. Until you have railroads,
irrigate most plains and mine most grassland - this of course varies
per city. For more on workers, see this <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/cracker/civ3_starts/index.htm" target="_blank">this very detailed article</a> on early game worker managment.<br>
<br>
<b>What is "REX" or "REXing"?</b><br>
<br>
REX stands for <i>R</i>apid <i>Ex</i>pansion. This is a strategy
some people use in the beginning turns of a game: the goal is to
basically expand as fast as possible, claiming as much territory as you
can (as more territory usually equals more power), even at the expense
of military and defense sometimes. This involves building a granary
early on to promote growth, and then literally pumping out settlers and
workers, with few military units for city defense. Once all land
available has been taken up, then you can resume normal production of
other units. This strategy works most of the time, although you should
always be wary of the AI if they have any units lurking around! <br>
<br>
<b>What do the following terms mean:  ICS, OCP, Tight, and Loose Placement?</b><br>
<br>
All these terms relate to the density of your cities when it comes to
city placement. Each city placement strategy is different and has its
own benefits and disadvantages. Here's an overview: ICS is Infinite
City Sprawl, which means you try to pack in as many cities as you can,
usually at the minimum 2 tiles apart (e.g. City - Tile - City - Tile -
City). It's mostly used in games with a goal of an early military
victory or a culture victory (as more cities = more culture being
produced). Corruption can get pretty high though. Tight placement means
your cities are usually 3 tiles apart, so that, with roads, units can
be moved from city to city in only one turn. This takes advantage of
the fact that most cities won't use more than 10-12 tiles until they
build a Hospital, if they do at all. It's used mostly at higher levels.
Loose placement is like tight placement, except cities are around 4
tiles apart, to take advantage of more tiles per city. OCP is Optimal
City Placement, where each city does not overlap with another - they
use all 21 tiles for one city only. It's best on lower levels where you
can gain many cities this way, because, on higher levels, you won't be
able to fit in many cities this way. For more on OCP, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/buildersdream1.php" target="_blank">this article</a>, and for more on city placement in general, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/city_placement.php" target="_blank">this article</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the most common early military strategy?</b><br>
<br>
A popular military tactic to use early in the game is called the
"swordsmen rush", or "sword rush". Because the best attacker in the
Ancient Age is a swordsman with an attack of 3, and the best defender
(spearman) only has 2 defense, many people choose to found a couple
early cities, and quickly build barracks in them. Then, they will amass
a sizeable force of swordsmen, and use that to declare war on their
neighbors before they can build up their defense. Of course, this
strategy require the civilization has access to Iron needed to build
swordsmen, but if they do, this tactic can gain them a lot of early
land and hurt the AI for the rest of the game. Variations of this
strategy also include using just horsemen if you have no Iron, or a
combination of swordsmen/horsemen/catapults for a more varied approach
against the AI. Also, view <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/basicstrats.php" target="_blank">this article</a> that deals with this strategy too.<br>
<br>
<b>I keep reading about "settler factories".  What are they and how do I set them up?</b><br>
<br>
A 'settler factory' is a city designed early in the game to produce
only settlers, one every four turns (alternatively, it can do a worker
every two turns). They help greatly in expansion as there is a constant
stream of settlers, however, if you are not used to them, they can be
somewhat hard to find, plan, and set up. Here are the basics: the city
you plan on setting up a settler factory in must have some bonus food
resources. If you aren't Agricultural, 2 cows will work - if you are,
you can make do with only 1 cow, but 2 works just fine as well. Combine
this with a granary, and you only need 10 extra food to grow a
population point. Because of the bonus food, if you reach the 'golden'
5 food per turn, you will grow every 2 turns. Thus, in 4 turns, you
will make up for the fact that a settler uses up two population points
to build. Then, all you have to do is just gain the required amount of
shields. If you are at size 5, and have 7 shields per turn, you will
gain 14 shields over 2 turns. When you grow, you'll be at size 6 for 2
more turns until you get the 10 food needed, and by doing so, let's say
you gain 8 shields per turn, or 16 total. Fourteen plus sixteen is 30,
or the number of shields a settler costs. Therefore, in 4 turns, you
grew 2 population points, and you also collected 30 shields, enough to
build a settler. The cycle can then repeat. One last thing: you don't
have to do this at size 5 to 6 or with those amount of shields per
turn. For more, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/deity_settlers1.php" target="_blank">this article</a> as well as <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/strategy/settler_factory.php" target="_blank">this one</a>.<br>

<a name="PTW"><font size="4"><b>Play the World Expansion Pack</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>This section details the additions and changes in Play the World, Civilization III's first expansion pack.</b><br>
<br>
<b>What civilizations did Play the World add?</b><br>
<br>
Play the World added 8 new civilizations, using the 6 existing traits from <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> (UU stands for Unique Unit, and the 3 numbers stand for their Attack.Defense.Movement):<br>
<blockquote><i>Celts:</i>  Militaristic and Religious (changed to Agricultural in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>), their UU is the Gallic Swordsman (replaces Swordsman) at 3.2.2<br>
<br>
<i>Mongols:</i> Militaristic and Expansionist, their UU is the Keshik
(replaces Knight) at 4.2.2 and treats hills/mountains as grassland for
movement<br>
<br>
<i>Spanish:</i>  Religious and Commercial (changed to Seafaring in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>), their UU is the Conquistador (replaces Explorer) at 3.2.2 and all terrain as roads<br>
<br>
<i>Ottomans:</i>  Scientific and Industrious, their UU is the Sipahi (replaces Cavalry) at 8.3.3<br>
<br>
<i>Vikings:</i>  Militaristic and Expansionist (changed to Seafaring in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>), their UU is the Bezerk (replaces Longbowman) at 6.2.1 (7 attack in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>) and amphibious attack<br>
<br>
<i>Arabians:</i>  Religious and Expansionist, their UU is the Ansar Warrior (replaces Knight) at 4.2.3<br>
<br>
<i>Carthaginians:</i>  Militaristic and Religious (changed to Industrious and Seafaring in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>), their UU is the Numidian Mercenary (replaces Spearman) at 2.3.1<br>
<br>
<i>Koreans:</i>  Scientific and Commercial, their UU is the Hwach'a (replaces Cannon) and it has lethal bombard</blockquote><b>Were there any units added as well?</b><br>
<br>
There were just two additional units added in Play the World, besides
the Unique Units and units for the game modes (Regicide's kings and
Capture the Princess' princess). These were the Medieval Infantry
(4.2.1), requiring Iron and Feudalism, that serves to extend the
Swordsman's lifespan, as in <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>
it did not upgrade to anything. The second unit is the Guerilla
(6.6.1), a resourceless unit that comes with Replaceable Parts, that is
the modern version of the Medieval Infantry (they upgrade to Guerillas).<br>
<br>
<b>I read about people playing scenarios and modifications (mods) for Play the World!  Did these come with the game?</b><br>
<br>
On the Play the World CD, there were some included user-created scenarios and mods for <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b> and <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>,
that were basically the same as the ones you could download from the
forums here. Although some maps and scenarios were made for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>
only, you can still load them in Play the World, as the games are
backwards-compatible. While there were some created content that came
with Play the World, the majority of scenarios and mods people play
they have downloaded here at the forums from the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=46" target="_blank">Creation and Customization</a> section, as they have a wider variety of modifications that have been updated since the release of Play the World.<br>
<br>
<b>What are these new victory conditions?</b><br>
<br>
These new victory conditions, mostly for Multiplayer, but also playable
in Single Player, are Regicide, Mass Regicide, Elimination, Capture the
Princess and Victory Point scoring. For more, see <a href="#VICTORYCONDITIONS">this previous question</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Some screenshots with Play the World have a lot of buttons I don't have.  How do I get them?</b><br>
<br>
These 'advanced buttons' are new in Play the World, and for the most
part, they deal with the automation of units and workers, with such
buttons as "Road to", "Build trade network", and "Improve nearest
city". Another feature they provided is a button that allows you to
rename units! To see these advanced buttons, you can go to your
Preferences (Control + P) and turn on the "advanced buttons" option in
the top right corner.<br>
<br>
<a name="PTWMP"><b>Did Play the World come with Multiplayer?</b></a><br>
<br>
Yes, Play the World did ship with Multiplayer, unlike Vanilla!
Multiplayer allows you to play a normal game of civilization, or even a
scenario or mod, against other humans, and possibly AIs if you like.
You can use all the features of Single Player, including all the
civilizations and the game modes that were intended for MP. The only
limitation is that only 8 civilizations, human and AI together, can
play at once. After loading the game and selecting "Multiplayer" on the
main menu, it takes you to the MP Lobby where you can talk with other
people and join/host a game. There are 4 modes of multiplayer:<br>
<blockquote><i>Internet:</i> The most commonly used form of Multiplayer
- after going to the Lobby, you can scan currently running games for
one to join, or you can start your own.<br>
<br>
<i>LAN:</i> This mode is like Internet except that you can setup the
game over your LAN, if you have one, so that you can play a game with
other friends on your network.<br>
<br>
<i>Hotseat:</i> This style involves the use of one computer, playing
turn-based style. One person plays his turn, then the next person plays
his turn on that computer, then the next, etc. This works well if you
only have 1 computer with Civilization, but a group of friends that
want to play.<br>
<br>
<i>Play by Email (PBEM):</i> Playing PBEM works in the following way:
one person receives the save in their email box, loads it up into
Civilization, plays their one turn, and then saves and sends it to the
next person. While slow, it is a stable form of the game, and it is not
too bad if you can get at least 1 turn a day in. Most people are either
strong fans of it or think it to be useless.</blockquote>You can also
select "Direct IP" in the Lobby which will connect you to another
computer via IP Address if you want to play a game with your friend
without setting it up in the Lobby. There are two turns of game play,
unlike Single Player. Turn based is the same as SP, where one
civilization plays after another. The new one is Simultaneous Moves,
where all civilizations move at the same time (warfare gets complex),
and optionally, you can set a turn timer so that the turn ends no
matter what after a certain length of time. For more, see the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=87" target="_blank">Multiplayer</a> forum.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="CONQUESTS"><font size="4"><b>Conquests Expansion Pack</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>This section details the additions and changes in Conquests, Civilization III's second and last expansion pack.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Do I have to buy Play the World before Conquests?  How do I get that Play the World content?</b><br>
<br>
No, you do not have to buy Play the World if you do not have it, as
Conquests has all the content from Play the World, including the new
civilizations and units. However, the one part of Play the World that
is not on the Conquests CD is the extra 'flavor' units from Feudal
Japan, Dinosaur, and WWII that are in Play the World's 'extras' folder.
Fortunately, though, you can download them legally here at CivFanatics
in <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=69439" target="_blank">this thread</a> as well as <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=69446" target="_blank">this one</a> (the Feudal Japan ones are available from the Sengoku Conquest's folder).<br>
<br>
<b>What are these "Conquests" I've heard are in this expansion?</b><br>
<br>
Included on the Conquests expansion pack CD were 9 "Conquests", or
Firaxis-made scenarios, each representing a specific period in history.
The nine of them are: Mesopotamia, Rise of Rome, Fall of Rome, Middle
Ages, Mesoamerica, Age of Discovery, Sengoku, Napoleonic Europe, and
WWII in the Pacific. Each Conquest has its own map, civilization, and
units, and they all play out differently. Because they were made by
Firaxis who programmed Civilization III, they are of a high quality and
do not have many flaws. There is also a Conquest Hall of Fame, where
you can keep track of your best wins for each of the 9 Conquests. They
have proved popular in Succession Games and Single Player, and for the
most part, they are shorter than a regular game of Civilization,
allowing you to enjoy a scenario with a unique flavor.<br>
<br>
<b>Did Conquests also add new civilizations?</b><br>
<br>
Yes, there were 8 new civilizations, however, due to the way the game
was coded, only 7 can be represented in the game (a total of 31
civilizations) - the last, the Swiss, have to be modded in by the user
at the expense of another civilization. The new civilizations are:<br>
<blockquote><i>Mayans:</i> Agricultural and Industrious, their UU is
the Javelin Thrower (replaces Archer) at 2.2.1, and it can also enslave
enemy units into slaves (a one third chance each victorious battle)<br>
<br>
<i>Incans:</i> Agricultural and Expansionist, their UU is the Chasqui
Scout (replaces Scout) at 1.1.2, and it treats hills/mountains as
grassland<br>
<br>
<i>Byzantines:</i>  Seafaring and Religious, their UU is the Dromon (replaces Galley) at 2.1.2, and it has lethal sea bombard<br>
<br>
<i>Sumerians:</i>  Agricultural and Scientific, their UU is the Enkidu Warrior (replaces Warrior and Spearman) at 1.2.1<br>
<br>
<i>Portuguese:</i>  Expansionist and Seafaring, their UU is the Carrack (replaces Caravel) at 2.2.4<br>
<br>
<i>Dutch:</i>  Agricultural and Seafaring, their UU is the Swiss Mercenary (replaces Pikeman) at 1.4.1<br>
<br>
<i>Hittites:</i>  Commercial and Expansionist, their UU is the Three-Man Chariot (replaces Chariot), at 2.1.2</blockquote>The
Swiss' traits as well as their unique unit's stats are up to you, as
they are not in the game; you add them yourself, so you can give them
whatever abilities you want.<br>
<br>
<b>Were there any other new units added as well?</b><br>
<br>
Besides the 8 unique units and various scenario units, including ones
like Fire Cannons and Light Tanks, there were a few additional units
included in Conquests. These are the Flak and Mobile SAM units (land
units that have the ability to shoot down planes), TOW Infantry (a
resourceless Modern Age defender), Cruisers and Curraghs (naval units),
a Modern Paratrooper, as well as two units produced from Great Wonders,
the Crusader and the Ancient Cavalry.<br>
<br>
<b>I've read about two new traits - what are they?</b><br>
<br>
Conquests added two new traits: Agricultural and Seafaring. These were
added to eliminate a lot of overlap between civilization traits if they
had just used the original six - however, this also caused a good deal
of reshuffling of traits among Vanilla and Play the World
civilizations. For more on the benefits of the Agricultural and
Seafaring traits, see <a href="#TRAITS">this previous question</a> about this issue.<br>
<br>
<b>Are there any rule or gameplay changes in Conquests?</b><br>
<br>
There were some minor rule changes and gameplay tweaks introduced in
Conquests. Here is a brief overview of them, but for more, see <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=104294" target="_blank">this thread</a>:
defensive bombard (if a unit, like an archer, has this, it will attempt
to take off one hit point from the attacking unit, like a bombard
unit), lethal land and sea bombard (air units like bombers can now
totally kill units in an air strike), craters (if a bombard attack is
successful in destroying everyone on that tile, a crater will appear,
and it has to be cleared before it can be worked), barricades (an
upgraded fortress, built on a tile, and it provides 100% bonus to
defense as well as uses up all of a unit's movement points), two new
terrain types (marsh (just 1 food) and volcano (just 3 production, and
you can't improve it), four new resources (tobacco, sugar, oasis,
tropical fruit - all bonus resources), bonus technologies (Philosphy
now grants a free technology if researched first), and more. See the
mentioned thread for more rule changes.<br>
<br>
<b>What are these unit-producing wonders I've seen?</b><br>
<br>
Conquests also was the addition of a new feature: wonders that produce
units. There are two wonders in the regular game, the Statue of Zeus
(requires Ivory and Mathematics) and the Knights Templar (requires
Chivalry). Every 5 turns, for as long as the wonders haven't been
obsoleted by a technology, produce a unit, an Ancient Cavalry (3.3.2
and +1 hit point) and Crusader (5.2.1), respectively. While you still
have to pay upkeep on these units, they will appear every 5th turn in
the city where the wonder was built. Because you do not have to build
these units, these wonders are a good investment if you are not one to
build many units, or if you are planning a military conquest - either
way, they are useful. If you do not plan on using the units, you can
also disband the units in a city for shields.<br>
<br>
<b>Did Multiplayer get changed in any way?</b><br>
<br>
While Multiplayer was still included in Conquests from Play the World,
not much was changed, apart from some technical fixes. For more on how
Multiplayer works, see <a href="#MULTIPLAYER">the Multiplayer section</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="MULTIPLAYER"><font size="4"><b>Multiplayer</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>Do all versions of Civilization III have Multiplayer?  Are they compatible?</b><br>
<br>
No - only <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b> and <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>
have Multiplayer. Even so, the two versions cannot play each other,
that is, games must be Conquests-Conquests or Play the World-Play the
World; no mixing allowed. Also, without each game, the patch level of
all the players must be the same. As almost all MP games use the latest
patch, it is best to download it, and you can get them <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/patches/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>How does playing a game over the Internet work?</b><br>
<br>
An internet game involves multiple humans, each with their own computer
with Civilization, connecting to a game setup in the lobby. After one
person selects Host Game from the lobby (and possibly password protects
it if you want to play a game with certain players), other people (up
to 8 people total) can join. Then, it takes you to a game setup screen
where you can choose civilizations and the world setup. Once the game
has launched, the humans, and any AIs in the game, are playing a game
of Civilization against each other. The game continues until it is
either saved or someone wins, and the turns progress either in <a href="#SIMOVETB">turn based or simultaneous mode</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>How do I play a game over a LAN?</b><br>
<br>
Playing a game over a LAN is the same as the Internet, except that you
can only play against other computers hooked up to the network.
Otherwise, it is the same, and you can still have AIs, do diplomacy,
and chat. <br>
<br>
<b>How does Play by Email (PBEM) work?</b><br>
<br>
Play by Email is a very unique style of Multiplayer. It involves up to
8 people playing a game of Civilization literally 1 turn at a time.
After having one person set up a game, a player will take their turn,
then save the game, send it via email (out of game as Civilization has
no in game function for this) to the next player, and then they load
the save in Civilization. While slow, it is still Civilization and all
the strategy of the game is there. As long as players take their turn
promptly, and there aren't too many people in the game, it doesn't last
forever. This is also the style used for many inter-site competitions.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Hotseat?</b><br>
<br>
Hotseat is the form of Multiplayer that involves the use of just one
computer - perfect if you have a bunch of people, and only one computer
that Civilization is installed on. After setting one up with a maximum
of 8 people (humans and AIs), one player will take his turn, then it
will be someone else's turn, then another person's, and it continues in
this cycle until someone wins (or you save the game). Because of the
way this mode works, you can only play in turn based mode, not
simultaneous moves, as only 1 person/civilization is moving at a time.
Also, it is a good idea to set a password for each civilization in case
someone accidentally goes into another person's turn.<br>
<br>
<a name="SIMOVETB"><b>How does Simultaneous Moves and Turn Based mode work?</b></a><br>
<br>
Multiplayer has two modes of play. The first, just like Single Player,
is the turn based mode, where one civilization takes their turn after
another. While this is probably the most fair, it does take a long
time, which is why most Multiplayer players stick to the other method,
simultaneous moves (or "si-moves"). With this latter mode, all
civilizations take their turns at the same time, quickly speeding up
the game, especially if you have a lot of civilizaitons. It works for
most MP games, however, one of its downsides is the problem of "double
moves", or having a unit move at the end of one turn and then the start
of another turn, allowing it to move two tiles in a short amount of
time. At any rate, both styles have turn timers which allow you to set
a speed for how long the turn will last (based on a calculation of how
many units and cities there are). While there are two modes of turn
play, the game still remains the same.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the "Direct IP" button for?</b><br>
<br>
The Direct IP button allows you to connect right to a friend's computer
if you know their IP address and don't want to bother having to
coordinate hosting a game, joining it, etc. By clicking this button,
you can quickly enter their IP and go right to the game setup screen.
It allows you to bypass password protecting your game so no one else
joins and other unnecessary tasks.<br>
<br>
<b>Can you set up a "team game" or a "2 on 2"?</b><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, no, you can't, at least not so the game recognizes. The
closest you can come is having to create a scenario file in which you
have a locked alliance between certain civilizations, but that can get
a bit annoying. However, this doesn't prevent you from creating a 2v2
or any other team game amongst you all, but the game won't really see
that is what is going on.<br>
<br>
<b>What exactly is the lobby for?</b><br>
<br>
The lobby is basically the setup room for all the Internet games - it's
where they all start. From here, you can set up a game, join a game,
search for games based on type, and chat with other Multiplayer
fanatics. It is the starting place for all things Multiplayer on the
Internet.<br>
<br>
<b>How does diplomacy in Multiplayer take place?</b><br>
<br>
The one major different in Multiplayer diplomacy is that you cannot see
what the other human has (but you can for AIs). Other than that,
diplomacy in the 'real time' modes, Internet and LAN, are just like
normal Civilization where you can each put things on your side of the
bargaining table. However, in PBEM and Hotseat, it uses a method that
can sometimes take a couple turns to complete - the side that engages
diplomacy can first offer something on their side of the table, and
then they 'send' the deal to the other civilization. When they play
their turn, they'll get the updated trade table, where they can add
stuff to their side and change what is being negotiated. Then, when
each side has agreed on the deal, both must click the "Agree" button in
order for the trade to become reality!<br>
<br>
<b>How do I chat in Multiplayer?</b><br>
<br>
To chat, just press the "~" key to the left of the key for the number 1
on the keyboard. It will then bring up a box to enter your message. You
can use { } for bold text and [ ] for italics.<br>
<br>
<b>I have a problem or a question about Multiplayer.  Who can I ask?</b><br>
<br>
You can post your question or technical problem in the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=87" target="_blank">Multiplayer forum</a>, as well as giving <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=35588" target="_blank">this technical problem FAQ</a> a read.<br>
<br>

for PBEM games. There are usually always people to play a game with.
Alternatively, you could just go straight to the Multiplayer Lobby and
join an ongoing game.<br>
<br>
<b>Sometimes in the lobby I see a game that says "Ladder ONLY"!  What does this mean?</b><br>
<br>
The Ladder is a group of Civilization players that play regularly and
keep track of all the games played, as well as various statistics. It
is a great idea, however, this means that some games in the lobby are
just for players in the Ladder - if you are in the ladder, though, it's
open to you if you want. If you are interested in joining the ladder

<a name="CREATION"><font size="4"><b>Creation and Customization</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>This section is only intended to be an introduction to modifying Civilization III.  For more, see the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=46" target="_blank">Creation and Customization forum</a> and feel free to ask questions there.</b><br>
<br>
<b>What are the different types of modifications and created content I can download?</b><br>
<br>
There's a variety of material up for download. This includes user-made
maps, scenarios, unit graphics, graphic modpacks (the interface), and
regular modpacks (e.g. new units, rule changes, etc., but played on a
random map, unlike a scenario). In the modpack forums for example, you
could download something as simple as a new resource graphic to
something as complete as a finished mod that adds hundreds of units and
technologies! You don't have to worry about what game of Civilization
III you have, as things like graphic changes work in any version - it's
only scenarios and maps that are backwards-compatible and don't work if
it is, say, a Conquests scenario and you just have Vanilla. There are
always scenario and maps for each game.<br>
<br>
<b>How do I install a scenario/map/modpack?</b><br>
<br>
First things first: download the content you want (it is probably a
zipped file). Upon opening the zip, you'll most likely see a folder
and/or a scenario file. A map will just be a scenario file, as there
are no custom units/content. A scenario and mod will have both, since
there is new graphics and such along with a scenario file to load the
mod/scenario from. Now, you have to extract these folders and files to
your Civilization III scenario folder, where all custom material goes.
This folder is located in <i>C:/Program
Files/Infogrames Interactive/Civilization 3/Scenarios/ (if you have PTW
or C3C, go to that folder inside your Civ3 one before Scenarios)</i>.
Once you have dragged the folder and editor file to this scenarios
folder, you can run Civilization III and load your scenario, map, or
mod.<br>
<br>
<b>Once I've downloaded and installed a mod, how do I run it from inside the game?</b><br>
<br>
Loading a scenario, mod, or map from inside Civilization is easy. Once
at the main menu screen, just click the button that says "Load
Scenario" for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b> or "Civ-Content" for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
and select your mod's scenario file. There will also be a description
of the file provided. Continue to the next screen - if is a scenario or
map, you'll just have to choose a civilization and then it'll load. If
it is a mod, you have to choose your map settings as well as your
player settings. After this, you'll be playing your game!<br>
<br>
<b>What is this "editor"?  Do I have it?</b><br>
<br>
The editor is a program included with each version of Civilization III
(Vanilla, Play the World, Conquests each have their own) that allows
users to make basic changes or complex scenarios and mods - while it
does have its limitations, it is pretty flexible and open-ended. To
open the editor, first navigate to your Civilization III folder
(default: <i>C:/Program Files/Infogrames Interactive/Civilization 3/ -- if you have PTW or C3C, go to that folder inside your Civ3 one</i>).  Then, double click to open the editor (if you have <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>, it is named Civ3Edit, for <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, Civ3XEdit, and for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
Civ3ConquestsEdit). Once it is open, you will see various buttons and
menus allowing you to add terrain, resources, units, generate maps,
etc. While it's best to learn about the editor by experimenting around,
here are some basics you can do: make rule modifications (see the next
question), create a map by "painting" tiles and resources onto the
default all-ocean map, and generate random maps with different world
settings. If you have more questions about the uses of the editor, it's
advisable to see the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=46" target="_blank">Creation and Customization</a> forum.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the file extensions for the different games' editor files?</b><br>
<br>
Each Civilization III game has a different extension for their scenario file.  For <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>, it is .bic, for <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, the extension is .bix, and for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
it is .biq. As mentioned earlier, the editors are backwards-compatible
only, meaning they can open earlier games' files, but not newer ones
(for example, the Play the World editor can open by .bix and .bic
files).<br>
<br>
<a name="RULECHANGES"><b>How can I make simple rule changes to the game?</b></a><br>
<br>
Once you have opened the editor, from the menu at the top, select
"Scenario" and then "Custom Rules". Hit yes to the warning that
displays, and then you can modify the rules by selecting "Edit" and
"Edit Rules". From there, you'll see various tabs on different sections
of the game, from units' stats, to wonders' benefits, to how many moves
you can make on roads. After you are done, just save the scenario file
in your scenario folder, and you can play it in the game. There is one
warning, however: if you try to add something like a unit,
civilization, or wonder without the proper graphics and updating of
text files, the game will crash, so it is best to stick to modifying
already created ones at least in the beginning.<br>
<br>
<b>Is it possible to change the rules for every game I play via "New Game" rather than loading a scenario?</b><br>
<br>
Yes, you can change the default rules for the games created by
selecting "New Game", although in most cases it is best just to leave
rule changes as mods in your Scenarios folder. Each game uses a
standard scenario file for the rules used in default games. By opening
this file in your main game folder (named civ3mod.bic for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>, civ3X.bix for <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, and conquests.biq for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>) with the editor, you can <a href="#RULECHANGES">modify the rules</a>
in this scenario file. The changes you make the default rule file used
in the game will be represented whenever you generate a map in-game, so
it is a good idea to backup this file before you make changes.<br>
<br>
<b>What are some recommended mods?</b><br>
<br>
While there have been many modscreated, there are a few that stand out
because of their gameplay, complexity, creativity, and graphics. Here
are the ones generally agreed upon as some of the best (for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>):<br>
<blockquote><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=66060" target="_blank">Warhammer</a> (a fantasy-related mod)<br>

<br>
<b>How do you create or edit a map in the editor?</b><br>
<br>
Upon opening the editor, all you'll see is just a blank, blue map - it
is all ocean. If you want to edit this map, or any other map someone
else made, you are going to be using the horizontal bar. There are the
following buttons after the zoom in/out ones: turn the grid on or off,
edit terrain (you select the terrain type), edit resources, edit
overlays (rivers, roads, etc.), and edit the fog of war (if you want
some terrain to have to be discovered). All these buttons are easy to
use; you can start with the terrain button, and say you select
grassland - then you can click on tiles on the map and it will place
grassland there. To change the number of tiles being affected by your
clicking, you can select a bigger square (the buttons to the right) -
there is 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7. Now, going back to the buttons that
are grayed out (the create city and create unit butotns). These are
grayed out because it in order to place a unit or city, it has to have
a nationality, so you have to set the "active player", or who these
things will belong to. You can click the shield button, and then choose
a civilization from the third checkbox (the shortcut for this menu is
SPACEBAR). Now you will be able to place cities/units (to edit them
once they have been placed, for example, a city's name, just right
click it and select properties). The scenario properties button allows
you to edit information about the scenario (the name, description, # of
civs, etc), and the globe button allows you to generate random maps, if
you want to work off a random map rather than creating one from
scratch. That's all there is to it!<br>
<br>
<b>Can I play on a world map?  Are there any world maps out there?</b><br>
<br>
Yes, you can - and while there are two world maps included on the <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>
CD, these are necessarily the best you can find. There are some
incredible map makers here on this forum that have created very
realistic world maps. Bewarned, however, that many of them are beyond
Huge (e.g. bigger than 160x160), though there are some below this. To
check them out, I suggest you visit the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=52" target="_blank">user-created maps</a>
forum and search for world maps for your game. However, there are some
maps that are generally agreed upon as very well done, and here is a
short list of them (all of them are for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>):<br>
<blockquote><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=80235" target="_blank">el_mencey's</a> <i>362x325</i> map<br>

<br>
<a name="MISCELLANEOUS"><font size="4"><b>Miscellaneous Questions</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>What do radar towers/outposts/airfields do?</b><br>
<br>
These three terrain buildings were added in <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>,
and they each can be created by a worker in neutral or your territory
by clicking their respective button. If you use a worker to build one
of them, the worker will 'get killed during construction' (e.g. he
disappears from the game), and then you will now have your building.
They are created instantly, and do not require any maintenance or
anything. Radar towers provide a 25% boost to your units that attack
and defend within 2 tiles of a radar tower. Outposts provide line of
sight and eliminate fog of war from surrounding tiles (their range is 2
for flat land, 3 for hills, 4 for mountains). An airfield allows planes
to rebase there and conduct missions as well as letting paratroopers do
an air drop without having to build a city with an airport on that tile.<br>
<br>
<b>What is global warming?</b><br>
<br>
Global warming in Civilization III is when the 'world' heats up due to
an increase in pollution-producing buildings (such as factories) and
the use of nuclear weapons. The current state of the world is
represented by a sun figure in the information box in the lower right
of the screen - once that sun appears (in the Industrial Age), it means
global warming has started. Global warming has the power to change
tiles, for example, every few turns some grassland tiles might turn
into plains, and plains into desert. If global warming is very strong
(the sun is burning red), lots of tiles will change a turn - coast
tiles can even dry up!<br>
<br>
<b>What is a map's "seed number"?</b><br>
<br>
The seed number for a map is like it's identification number - each map
has a different one. The game uses this seed along with the map
settings you chose to create a random map, and because of the number of
digits in each seed, it is highly unlikely you (or anyone else) will
ever play the same map twice! For example, in <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>,
where you can enter a seed (a string of numbers or letters) in the
World Selection screen, if you entered the same seed twice and had the
same settings for the game, you would get the same world. The seed
number can also be used to play on the same world twice if you want to
try another map again, or if someone tells you a really fun map and its
seed number. You can also use <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=87973" target="_blank">this utility</a> to extract the game seed as well as game settings from a saved game.<br>
<br>
<b>How does pollution work?</b><br>
<br>
Pollution, which can be created either as a result of buildings (like
factories) or too much population crowding, is represented by orange
splotches on the map in a tile. For each population point you have
above 12, you will get 1 pollution 'point', and buildings will give
different amounts of pollution as well. You can see how much pollution
you have in a city by going to the city screen, and in the bottom left
looking in the box labeled "Pollution". The more you have, the more
chances there is that pollution will occur in one of the city's 21
tiles each turn. Also, you can limit population pollution by building
Mass Transit (which caps population pollution at 1) and building
pollution by constructing Recycling Center (which limits building
pollution to 1).<br>
<br>
<b>What is the probability my city will flip via culture to another AI and vice versa?</b><br>
<br>
"Culture flipping" is when a city leaves their civilization to join
another because their cultural borders are being encroached by another
civilization's. The probability of a culture flip depends on other
factors too, such as distance to respective capitals, units, foreign
citizens, total culture, and others. The formula is:
P=[(F+T)*Cc*H*(Cte/Cty) - G]/D, where P = probability that it will flip
this turn, F = # foreignors, with resistors counting double, T = #
working tiles under foreign control (out of the max of 21, no matter
what the cultural boundaries are atm), Cc = 2 if foreign civ has more
local culture than you, 1 otherwise, H = .5 for WLTKD, 2 for disorder,
1 otherwise, Cte = Total culture of the foreign civ, Cty = Total
culture of your civ, G = # garrison units, D = factor based on relative
distance to capitals. As you can see, it is quite a complex formula,
but luckily there are utilities out there to calculate it! <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=118540" target="_blank">CivAssist II</a>, <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=53157" target="_blank">the Flip Calc</a>, <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=53181" target="_blank">"Babylon II Flip Calc"</a>, and <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=53228" target="_blank">this HTML Flip Calc</a> all get the job done!<br>
<br>
<b>What are the maximum and minimum research times?</b><br>
<br>
These values, which you can set in the editor, determine the minimum
and minimum amount of turns it takes you to research a technology. For
all three games, the minimum research length is 4 turns. In <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b> and <b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>, the maximum is 40 turns.  For <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, that was upped to 50 turns as the maximum.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the keyboard shortcuts for this game?</b><br>
<br>
You can view a complete list of keyboard shortcuts <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=7359" target="_blank">here</a> in the downloadable PDF file on the first page.  <br>
<br>
<b>How is my score calculated?</b><br>
<br>
The scoring formula in Civilization III is pretty simple. The actual
formula is: (Territory + HappyCitizens*2 + ContentCitizens +
Specialists) * Difficulty (Territory = # of tiles, Difficulty = 1 for
Chieftain, 2 for Warlord, etc.). As you can see, there aren't many
factors that go into it, and basically you just want to get a ton of
territory and population if you are going for a high score. While
things like units and technologies don't figure into the formula
directly, they do affect it, as usually, the more units you have, the
more territory you can gain, which <i>will</i>
increase your score. There is also a bonus you get at the end if you
win before 2050 AD, which is: (2050 - FinishYear) * Difficulty.<br>
<br>
<b>Why can't my leader build an army?</b><br>
<br>
For each army, you must have 4 cities - that is, if you want to have 4
armies, you need at least 16 cities. If you move a leader to a city and
you do not see the Build Army button, check to make sure you have
enough cities, factoring in cities needed for already existing armies
as well.<br>
<br>
<b>What do the colors of my city's population number mean?</b><br>
<br>
A city's population number on the main screen can be 1 of 3 colors:
red, white, or yellow. These indicate the current state of the city's
growth - if it is red, the city is losing food and citizens are
starving. If it stays red long enough, the city will lose population
points. If the number is yellow, it indicates there is no growth, or
the city is not able to grow (e.g. it is size 12 and has no Hospital)
any farther. A white number means the city is growing, and, after a few
turns when the food storage is full, the city will grow.<br>
<br>
<b>What do the numbers in the lower right information box like "1.9.0" mean?</b><br>
<br>
These 3 numbers indicate the levels of your Science and Luxury Tax
sliders on the F1 Domestic Advisor screen. From left to right, they
represent what percentages are going to Taxes (e.g. not to Science or
Luxury Tax), Science, and Luxury Tax (so it is
Taxes.Science.LuxuryTax). Remember that for each "1" in these numbers,
it represents 10% out of your budget of 100%.<br>
<br>
<b>What do acronyms like "MGL" and "TGL" mean?</b><br>
<br>
There are a lot of acronyms used for Civilization III, and some, like
TGL, can have multiple meanings (The Great Library, The Great
Lighthouse). For an explination of many Civilization-related and
regular acronyms, see <a href="http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3/reference/Civ3_jargons.txt" target="_blank">this page</a>.<br>

<b>How do I upload a saved game or screenshot?</b><br>

<a name="UTILITIES"><font size="4"><b>Helpful Utilities</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>What are "utilities" for Civilization III?  What do they do?  Are they free?</b><br>
<br>
Utilities are downloadable programs (not made by Firaxis, but rather by
Civilization enthusiasts) that run either while you play Civilization
or when Civilization is not open, and they provide you with extra
information, "micromanagement" tips, and trade opportunities, to name a
few. Although these utilities are not made by Firaxis, they still are
very complete, and some update as you play your game via autosaves,
allowing you to see current information. They also save you time, as,
like CivAssist II, one utility that is quite popular, they show what
each civilization has available to trade and what you can trade them,
saving you the struggle of checking their diplomacy table in game every
turn. Also, some check to see if any of your cities will riot in the
upcoming turn, and they warn you that the city will do so unless you
switch around the citizens. All of them are free, and they are a great
way not only to be more careful and improve your game, but also to have
more fun and spend less time doing repetitive actions.<br>
<br>
<b>Do they work for just a certain game or patch?</b><br>
<br>
No, most of the utilties work for any game of Civilization III, and any patch level.  <br>
<br>
<b>What are some recommended utilities?</b><br>
<br>
There are many utilities out there available for download, but there
are some that are very popular and unique. Here are a few of the best
utilities, along with a short description of their features:<br>
<blockquote><i><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=118540" target="_blank">CivAssist II</a></i>
- CivAssist II is one of the best utilities out there due to its wide
array of information, clear presentation, and good interface. It runs
in the background while running Civilization, and if you turn the alert
box on, each turn it will warn you of cities about to riot, nearby
enemy units, wasted production, available trades, deals about to end,
and more. The actual program itself has tabs for a variety of things
such as Military, Technologies, and your Cities. An amazing feature, if
not the best, is the ability to view the world map, see your cities,
terrain, and units in CivAssist II - all without having to open
Civilization! <br>
<br>
<i><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=52902" target="_blank">CRpSuite</a></i>
- among the programs in this suite of utilities are CRpStats, that
provides a great deal of statistics and numbers from in game,
CRpViewer, allowing you to view a replay of your game and even compare
it to another saved game, as well as CRpRings, to help plan out city
locations for settlers. However, the most popular program in the suite
is CRpMapStat. Originally created to see how many tiles there were
until Domination victory would be reached, it has evolved tremendously,
into a utility to displays detailed citizen info, trade opportunities,
territory calculations, cultural expansions, and resource locators.<br>
<br>
<i><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=75992" target="_blank">MapFinder</a></i>
- designed for the CivFanatics Hall of Fame players, this utility
generates maps automatically while you have Civilization open and you
aren't at the computer (for example, sleeping). The best part about
this utility, however, is that you can set rules for maps you want to
keep. If you wanted a map with 3 cows in the starting location, the
MapFinder will generate maps with your preferred world and player
settings until it finds the number of maps you want with, in this case,
3 cows. This makes finding a playable map a lot easier if you have
specific requirements in mind.<br>
<br>
<i><a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=54689" target="_blank">Civ3MultiTool</a></i>
- the ultimate saved-game utility, this allows you to do virtually
anything to the save, including add units to cities, change a player's
cities, give a civilization technologies, and more. With Civ3MultiTool,
you can also export the map your are playing on as an editor file so
you can play on it later.</blockquote>For more utilities, visit the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=54" target="_blank">Utility Programs</a> forum.<br>

<br>
<b>This section overviews various competitions, games, and ways to play
Civilization out of the regular Single Play and Multiplayer styles.</b><br>
<br>
<b>What is the Game of the Month (GOTM)?  Can I play?</b><br>
<br>
The <a href="http://gotm.civfanatics.net/" target="_blank">Game of the Month</a> is a single player competition here at CivFanatics aimed.  Once per month (the 1st of every month for <b><font color="DarkRed">Conquests</font></b>, the 15th for <b><font color="DimGray">Vanilla</font></b>/<b><font color="Navy">Play the World</font></b>),
the GOTM staff release a saved game to their website. Anyone that wants
to can download this save, play it out, and then submit it when they
are done, win or lose. The goal of the GOTM is to see the different
styles of play and outcomes of games, and by having everyone play the
same exact game, it puts everyone on an equal starting ground. There
are a few spoilers, or threads where people can share their progress up
to a certain date, for each game that allow you to compare and contrast
games as well as post how you're doing so far. The GOTM also uses the
latest patch for each game. For more, check out the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=49" target="_blank">Game of the Month</a> forum.<br>
<br>
<b>What are Succession Games (SGs)?</b><br>
<br>
Succession Games are casual single player games of Civilization played
with multiple people (usually 5 or 6). They acquired their name
because, after creating the game, the players play in succession. For
example, after posting a thread in the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=67" target="_blank">Succession Game</a>
forum and having a few people sign up, the game begins, and one person
sets up the game, plays the first turns (usually 20), and then posts
the save. The next person picks up that save and plays it (usually for
10 turns from here on out), posts it, and the cycle continues until
they win or lose. In a SG, you are also required to keep a log of your
turns so that the others who aren't playing the save know what went on.
To see examples, look at old SG threads, but it's usually something
like: "Turn 0, 4000 BC: Founded Paris on starting tile, starting
production of a warrior, worker moved onto river grassland". A SG is a
great way to learn the game of Civilization as well as improve your
game, as you are only responsible for 10 turns and you can always get
feedback and comments from others. For more, see the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=67" target="_blank">Succession Game</a> forum.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the Hall of Fame (HoF) at CivFanatics?</b><br>
<br>
The <a href="http://hof.civfanatics.net/civ3/index.php" target="_blank">Hall of Fame</a>
here at CivFanatics is a way for people to have their best games ranked
among other high-scoring games. After finishing a game, you can submit
it, and every few weeks, when there are updates made, as long as the
game was in the Top 10 of a category (something as simple as Deity
games, or a table for Small map size Space Race games on Regent), you
will see it listed. The Hall of Fame has sections for the Top 10
scoring games of every difficulty level, but then you can break it down
and narrow your field to include one of the 5 map sizes or one of the
victory conditions including score. Because of the variety of tables
they have, there are many that don't even have 10 games, so if you
submit a game that will fit there, it will be placed in the Hall of
Fame no matter what! There are a lot of tactics that Hall of Famers use
in their HoF games when trying to get high scores that most people
don't use in normal games, which is why a lot of their games are
incredible. For more on HoF strategies and how the Hall of Fame works,
see the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=76" target="_blank">Hall of Fame</a> forum.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the Multi-Team Demogame (MTDG)?</b><br>
<br>
The Multi-Team Demogame (short for Game of Democracy) is a semi-relaxed
Multiplayer competition here at CivFanatics between 4 teams of humans
played via Play by Email. Each team has their own private forum where
they discuss how to run their civilization and all the decisions that
come with it (this is where the "Democracy" part of the game comes in).
Every team decides themselves how to run their team - some just have 1
turnplayer who gathers the citizens' thoughts and then plays the turn;
others have positions that include a President and Military Advisor,
sort of mimicking the 6 advisors in Civilization III. Because the game
is played between humans, there are complex wars, alliances, and
diplomacy. This game has no obligations and some prefer just to sign up
for one team and watch the action from there. Others get very involved
in it, and either way works. If you are interested in more, see the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=149" target="_blank">Multi-Team Demogame</a> forum.<br>
<br>
<a name="FORUMRULES"><font size="4"><b>Forum Rules</b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>This is a reminder of the rules for this forum, the Civilization Fanatics' Forum.</b><br>
<br>
<b>What can't you post?</b><br>
You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not use this
forum to post any material which is knowingly false and/or defamatory,
inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, racist, hateful, harassing, obscene,
profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's
privacy, or otherwise violative of any law. You agree not to post any
copyrighted material unless the copyright is owned by you or by this
forum.<br>
<br>
<b>Use descriptive subject lines &amp; research your post.</b><br>
This reduces the chances of double-posting and it also makes it easier
for people to see what they do/don't want to read. Also, scan the
subjects of the last several days' posts to make sure you aren't
duplicating posts.<br>
<br>
<b>Keep the focus.</b><br>
Each forum has a focus on a certain topic. Questions outside the scope
of a certain forum will either be moved to the appropriate forum,
closed, or simply be deleted. Please post your topic in the most
appropriate forum.<br>
<br>
<b>Zero tolerance on piracy.</b><br>
Posting links to warez sites and program cracks (including no-CD crack)
are not allowed on the forum. Anyone found guilty of participating in
piracy activity on the forum will be punished.<br>
<br>
<b>Spam is not tolerated.</b><br>
Spam is considered posting topics or messages on our forums that
contain no point, relevance, or contain subject matter that doesn't
directly allow other member participation. Topics directed to a
particular user, posting several times consecutively as an appendage to
ONE post, and posts in threads that have NOTHING to do with the subject
matter are all considered spam and will be deleted on sight.
Contributing to/or intentionally posting spam will not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
<b>Keep your signature brief.</b><br>
This forum has a signature feature that allows you to "sign" your posts
with a customized block of text. The text may include links to other
sites (as long as they are within the forum rules) and emoticons. No
derogatory references to other members, spoiler tags, or quote tags are
allowed in signatures.<br>
<br>
Signatures are limited to 5 lines of regular (size 2) text. Using
smaller text (size 1) allows 7 lines of text. Larger text (size 3)
allows 3 lines of text. No text size larger then size 3 should be used.
The number of lines for any text size includes blank lines and room
used by emoticons and is evaluated at 1024x768 resolution.<br>
<br>
<b>Multiple accounts are not permitted.</b><br>
Create one account, make sure you're satisfied with the name, and keep
it. Be sure to choose your user name carefully. If you wish to change
your user name for whatever reason, please contact <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=1" target="_blank">Thunderfall</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Postcount titles &amp; avatars.</b><br>
Each poster has a title and an optional avatar image shown below
his/her username. The default titles are Chieftain, Warlord, Prince,
King, Emperor, and Deity. The minimum postcounts required are listed
below:<br>
<blockquote>Chieftain (Minimum Posts: 0)<br>

<br>
If you have 30 posts AND have registered for 30 days, you can give
yourself a custom title and a custom non-animated avatar. The dimension
limit of custom avatars is 70x70 pixels and size limit is 4 KB. You can
change your title or avatar in your <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/usercp.php?s=" target="_blank">User CP</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Images and file attachments</b><br>
Currently we have the [img] tag and the file attachment feature
enabled. For files under 500 KB, you may use the attachment feature to
attach the file. In addition, you can use Easy Upload to upload bigger
files to the file server. You can help free up valuable forum server
space and also improve forum performance by deleting any attachments
you no longer need at the <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/profile.php?do=editattachments" target="_blank">attachment management</a> section of your User CP.<br>
<br>
If you need to attach images often, we recommend using these easy to use free image hosting services: <a href="http://www.photobucket.com/" target="_blank">PhotoBucket</a> or <a href="http://www.imageshack.us/" target="_blank">ImageShack</a>. For temporary hosting of large files or if you need to send a big file to another member, you can use the free <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/" target="_blank">YouSendIt</a> service, which allows you to upload up to 1 GB and they host the file for 1 week.<br>
